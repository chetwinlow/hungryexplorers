The Whole Boston Lobster in Thai Dressing is another dish that shows off a creative sauce — this time, made from fish sauce, lime and chilli, and diced mangosteens and tomatoes. For lighter, more refreshing fare, try the Sashimi of Hamachi. The fleshy slices are plumped up with a zesty calamansi gel, ponzu sauce, and a smattering of slightly bitter and crunchy garlic chips.

The kitchen team takes pride in the food they cook, as seen from the attention to detail — Carbonara, for instance, is a favourite pasta dish with slivers of juicy bacon and a precise 62°C Poached Egg. The restaurant’s signature dish, a Semi-House Smoked Chicken Breast Linguine, is also a delight to tuck into. The slippery, al dente pasta is made fresh daily, as is the tangy tomato sauce enveloping this dish. The chicken is lightly-smoked, juicy, and flavourful. For a heartier main course, try the 150 Days Grain-Fed Angus Braised Beef Cheek. The beef is cooked sous vide for hours, so that the meat is meltingly soft and fork-tender, suffused with a rich, heady flavour from the gravy. Be sure to save some space for dessert.

Even humble dishes like porridge are jazzed up with the addition of a succulent lobster.\r\n\r\nAnother reason that makes this place a gem is its ambience.

Searching for something comforting? Then why not order up one of E!GHT’s many stews? Top picks include Beef Kimchi Stew, Seafood Bean Paste Stew, and the Army Stew.

This charming, tastefully decorated restaurant will welcome diners with warm, positive vibes from the moment they step in (think lots of wood and brick in the interiors). Lovely décor wouldn’t mean very much without great grub, though, and we’re happy to say that Acqua e Farina’s mouthwatering list of Italian treats, made from produce mostly imported from Italy, is an absolute delight.\nLuxuriate in Italian culinary heaven with dishes like the signature Pizza Acqua e Farina, with its delectable toppings of salami, tomato, mozzarella, ricotta cheese, and sautéed spinach. Each bite will unleash a delicious medley of flavours, and before you know it you’ll be chowing down with unexpected enthusiasm and speed! The pastas aren’t to be sneezed at either – the Spaghetti ai Gamberi is bound to impress with its helpings of oh-so-fresh prawns and a spiciness that gives it extra ‘kick’. Finally, few meals are complete without a dessert to round things off – and if you’re unsure of what to get, why not try the Piatto di Dolci?

Vegetarianism's stauncher cousin has gained itself a reputation for not being the tastiest stuff in the world, often relegated to the classification of rabbit food. Afterglow, the hip outpost in the Keong Saik area, aims to change that perception with intriguing, creative raw fare that defies expectations.\nAfterglow has hippie chic intentions that go well beyond its inventive decor. The concept was born out of local ingredient sourcing and improving the lifestyles of city dwellers with wholesome, natural fare. Evolving the industrial look with a vintage, trinket-filled aura, the communal space is used to showcase on-theme books, accessories and even wines. This is your first indication that the approach here is not all pious, with additional edge given by artisanal cold brew, small-batch coffee, and craft beer to suit the lively neighborhood after dark.\nRegardless of your familiarity with raw vegan dishes, the menu at Afterglow aims to please. To start, the Raw vegan nut 'cheese' platter with crackers uses cultured cashews, soaked and pureed to recreate the smooth texture of a cheesy dip, miraculously sans any actual dairy. The accompanying crackers made of whole seeds and grains deliver a satisfying crunch, and the dip is so tasty that you'd never know it has added probiotic benefits. The sushi-like Afterglow kimchi nori rolls uses faux rice made with almonds and homemade Kimchi that has been stewing in zingy marinades for 7 days. Venturing into Mexican territory, the Raw taco bowl substitutes the seasoned beef for chunky walnuts spiced with a blend of salsas and crunchy purple cabbage, for a refreshing take on usually belt-busting burritos. For a more Italian spin, the Raw lasagne smartly deceives the tongue with zucchini as the pasta sheets, and macerated tomatoes as the sauce.\nThe Drag-pom salad is ideal for raw-vegan newbies and naysayers alike, featuring an undeniably good combination of dragonfruit with pomegranate, avocado, and macadamia. Also sure to please any palate is the Raw chocolate salted caramel fudge, featuring raw avocado and cacao, layered with sesame-based tahini cream, and a vanilla-medjool sweetened crust for a delightfully guilt-free treat. And really, doesn't that make it all the sweeter?

From the invitingly open arched doors to the signature blues and whites of the Mediterranean coating the interiors, everything, including the food, will transport you to Greece.\n\nFor full authenticity, the produce is brought here, fresh from the Aegean Sea, and items on the menu are crafted by hand, which might explain the depth of flavour in dips like Taramosalata (fish-roe cream) and Melitzanosalata (smoked eggplants with walnuts). Of course, there’s more than pita and dips on the menu. Fill up on amazing Salt-Baked Fresh Fish, grilled gems like the Octopus and Squid – simply named but complex on the tongue – and mains like Kotopoulo Souvlaki (grilled chicken with fried potatoes and yoghurt) as well as Mousaka (minced beef, eggplant, potatoes and béchamel sauce).

From the folks behind A Poke Theory, Alter Ego is the evil twin of the beloved healthy eating joint on Boon Tat street. Serving Poke Bowls till evening, and indulgent grub with booze afterward, everything on the menu screams #foodporn.\n\nThe brunch menu is a sight to behold - featuring everything from decadent desserts to brunch staples with a twist. Artfully created thickshakes are available in a range of flavours - from peanut butter to matcha. The Matcha Maniac is particularly noteworthy for its lush green colour and generous serving of rich chantilly cream. If sugar isn’t your thing, the Pokecado Toast comes in the same lovely green shade, with velvety smashed avocado on sourdough topped with spiced roasted cashews and crispy tempura batter.\n\nPrefer some bubbly? The bar bites are as indulgent as poke is healthy. From Southern Fried Chicken Skin to local favourite Har Cheong Kai starting from just $4, you could be forgiven for wanting to try them all in one sitting. Their Happy Hour deals are pretty darn great as well - an array of $6 bottled beers and cold pints going from $10 and up. In a place like this where both food and drinks appease those at either ends of the clean or indulgent eating spectrum, you'll find solace in knowing it'll hit all the right spots.

And yes, their teppanyaki selection heats things up with Surumeika Teppanyaki, with squid and butter soyu. \r\n\r\nEven if you’re just here for drinks, you’ll be tempted by their selection of bar snacks on offer. Have the best of everything with the Ameising Platter, consisting of Amaebi, Tako, Popcorn Chicken, Kawa Karaage, and Curry Samosa. For something lighter, opt for the Sashimi Platter instead.\r\n\r\nLunch includes wallet-friendly options such as the set lunch of grilled selections or sashimi, which comes with salad, miso soup, rice, and pickles. If you prefer a fuss-free alternative, their rice, noodle, and grain bowls pack a punch — we recommend their Poke Bowl Soba, Quinoa Bowl, and Ribeye Soba. \r\n\r\nTheir fully stocked sake collection even has a helpful sake meter value to help you narrow your choices from sweet to dry. Ameising Tapas & Bar’s Cocktail Diary Series features different cocktails on Wednesdays, so look out for it!

Be sure to try the Paya. These trotters are seasoned with a diverse mix of spices and left to cook overnight over a slow fire, creating a flavourful and tender bite. Awadh also has vegan options such as the “Impossible” kebabs or curries. Committed to showcasing the culinary heights of Northern India, the menu at Awadh changes with each season, and is unique to the festivals that mark the month. Thus, Awadh promises each and every diner and new and wholly unique experience.

At Awfully Chocolate cafes, we serve our desserts the way we believe they should be experienced. Many of the cakes are served warm with a scoop of our chocolate ice-cream, and recommend with a contrasting artisanal tea or gourmet coffee, or for the connoisseurs, mocha royale or classic dark chocolate.

With a hip culture tailor-made for Tras Street, BAM! hits all the high notes.\nMerging two cuisines is hardly groundbreaking, however BAM!'s inspired blending of Spanish tapas with small plates that are meant to be shared, and a Japanese sake-flowing izakaya, is spot on. The category is a bit hazy - is it a tapakaya? sakapas? - but whatever you choose to call it, the dining experience here is nothing short of uproarious.\nThe digs are adequately cool kid-chic, with the requisite hipster trimmings of concrete and not much else. Nude bulbs and the underbelly of the dining room's wiring are starkly exposed. Despite the naked decor, BAM! is not blushing at all with a boldly confident gastronomic vision and spot-on flavours. The vibe draws on the hearty camaraderie of Spanish bars with the real world grit of izakayas, for a pitch-perfect air of laidback dining.\nThe menu reads like a daily market billboard, hailing the freshest and peak-season ingredients. There are some mainstays though that have earned their permanent placement. The Pasta a la Plancha with Prawn and Sake Butter is next-level umami, with just enough acidity from the wine. And sake doesn't just make a one-time appearance, with a glassed-in cooler of both popular and hard-to-find brands. The resident sake sensei will not only pair your dishes with ample pours, but will show you how to really make the most of it, encouraging you to drizzle the wine into the luscious Kampong Egg with crispy squid and punchy chorizo, another menu regular.\nAs its name suggests, BAM! is loud and proud of its excellent fusion angle. The hip setting, top-notch food, and unique sake spin, make it deserving of its exclamation point.

Offering up a smorgasbord of delectables that are sure to make your mouth water, this restaurant expertly tempers classic Thai spices and cooking techniques with a modern sensibility for a combination that works.\r\nHave an appetising serving of the restaurant’s Tod Mun Pla, and savour the explosion of flavours with every bite you take –  you won’t be forgetting these fish cakes in a hurry, that’s for sure - or dip your spoon into a delightfully spicy bowl of Tom Yum Goong, which comes with helpings of sweet and juicy prawns to add on to the sour tang. If you’re a dessert person, then the Tap Tim Krob, or red rubies topped with coconut ice cream, will be a perfect, refreshing way to end your meal.

Rather than soaring high above the sparkling city, with knee shaking views of the ground below, you perch happily on the fourth floor for a similarly sunny outlook without the extra fuss that comes with extra altitude. Here the vibe is laid back, as you literally lean upon low slung, canary yellow deck seating.

Chef Stephane Istel was determined to open his own restaurant by the time he was thirty-five years old, and the food on offer at the modern rotisserie and bar provides an intimate insight into the experiences that have made the man.\nThe heart of the menu, of course, is made up of the meats from the rotisserie. Both the French Free Range Chicken and Australian Pork knuckle have won rave reviews, and we could definitely understand why. But don't fixate on just those items though, because while the rotisserie may be the heart, Chef Stephane's deft touch and heartfelt recipes are the soul of what's on offer. Whether it be the tarte flambee, signature to his home town of Alsace, or his mother's apple pie recipe, there's a delicate balance of tradition and modernity in the food and the decor that makes the entire experience undeniably unique.\nAnd when you finally look up from your empty plate, sated and satisfied, contemplate the open kitchen and the stoic, rustic materials of stone, wood, and cement. There's a soft harmony to the design that maintains an elegant poise, a perfect mirror to the generous food served by Chef Stephane paired with the impeccable service directed by manager Kori Millar. It's a restaurant born of dreams, love, and togetherness, and their motto, \"Love on the Plate\" couldn't be any more apt.

The ones at Basil & Thyme don’t shy away from the heat. Tuck into Kaeng Daeng, a creamy and spicy combination packed with your choice of chicken, beef, or seafood. For milder versions, try the Kaeng Khiew Hwan Gai, a lighter green curry that is more gentle on your tastebuds. Be sure to also order a side of roti (flat bread) to sop up all the spicy, creamy gravy. \r\n\r\nThe classic Pad Thai ranks high on the must-try list. Here, the stir-fried noodle dish is redolent with a smoky char, tossed with a generous helping of plump prawns, fresh seafood, or chicken. An interesting rice dish to try is the Khao Tom Pla, a watery congee made from soft-boiled rice with slices of tender fish. \r\n\r\nBe sure to save some space for dessert as well. The crowd-favourite Khao Niao Mamuang is one of the best versions of mango sticky rice in town, drizzled with a fragrant and rich house-made coconut cream.

Introducing Basque Kitchen — back after a brief hiatus — in its new home at the historic Fullerton Waterboat House.  \r\n\r\nThe second home marks the beginning of a new chapter for Basque Kitchen. Established in October 2018 as Singapore’s first Basque-centric restaurant celebrating the country’s indigenous culture and produce, Basque Kitchen was awarded its first Michelin Star in the 2019 edition of Michelin Guide Singapore.  \r\n\r\nIn the new location, Chef-Patron Aitor Jeronimo Orive — alumni of the Michelin-starred kitchens of The Fat Duck in London, Mugaritz in San Sebastián and Neura in Bilbao — and his team continue to stay true to the produce-driven culinary philosophy that their customers love, executed with even greater finesse while remaining approachable. The Basque gastronomic experience is also more immersive, with a pintxos bar and lounge welcoming diners to unwind over a flute of cuvee champagne created especially for the restaurant, and to tease the tastebuds with the diverse range of light bites. In the semi-open kitchen, a duo of handsome Josper grills, custom-designed for the restaurant, anchor the space, offering diners a glimpse of the deliciousness to come. Within the 38-seat main dining hall of the new Basque Kitchen, a private dining room that seats eight makes a perfect venue for small, discreet gatherings.  \r\n\r\nBasque Kitchen will also host the exclusive members-only space for American Express Centurion and Platinum Card Members, called Platinum at Basque Kitchen. Comprising 18 seats at the dining hall and 18 seats at the pintxos bar, the dedicated space boasts the finest views of the Fullerton waterfront. Centurion and Platinum Card Members will also enjoy priority reservations, and a suite of complimentary experiences including valet service and welcome drinks.\r\n\r\nAn Immersive Experience \r\n\r\nPremier design agency Grey Matters, the same behind the likes of Cloudstreet, Tippling Club, and W Maldives, draws on the elements of Earth, Water, Fire, Air — also considered the four cornerstones of Basque cooking — to create a space that marries rusticism with modern sophistication. Think the juxtaposition of charcoal stained oak floorboards against plush velvet banquettes; the cool of gleaming embossed metal detailing balanced by the buttery softness of cream-hued leather; rippled glass creating a dance of light as water does; contoured lines all around, reminiscent of the coast of the Basque country, facing the Bay of Biscay. Dressed in a harmonious palette of charcoal greys, warm orange and oaky tones and given accents of gold and copper, it’s a space that is as invitingly comfortable as an old friend’s home as it is elegantly refined and fitting of special occasions.  \r\n\r\nThe pinxtos bar and lounge that seats 33 persons sets the tone for enjoyment. From the a la carte menu comes exquisite offerings such as artisanal Sanfilippo anchovies — perfected over 125 years by five generations of a Cantabrian family and exclusively available in Singapore at Basque Kitchen — served simply with tomatoes atop crisp curasao flatbread; a classic dish of goose barnacle slivers served with tender nuggets of sous vide abalone, piparras olives, piquillo peppers; and a moreish wagyu burger with amera tomato, pickled cucumber, caramelised onions and epoisses cheese. Apart from the authentic light bites served on bar plates made by Catalan tableware design studio Luesma & Vega, patrons can also indulge in oysters served four ways, or caviar by the tin before moving on to the main meal.  \r\n\r\nIn the dining room, a tasting menu is offered exclusively for lunch and dinner (from $158++ for lunch to $248++ for dinner). Crafted using painstakingly sourced Basque produce, complimented by premium seasonal ingredients from Japan — such as deep sea fish, uni and scallops, the menus also showcase house-aged beef. In the aging fridge — two to three times bigger than before — prime cuts such as Australian and Japanese wagyu are meticulously dry-aged for a minimum of 45 days. Following the style in the Basque country, the team also sources for beef from mature livestock about eight years of age — that which presents intensely deep and complex flavours and textures. \r\n\r\nCharcoal-grilled items anchor the tasting menus: such as Charcoal grilled blackspot bream and razor clam dressed in a typically Basque Donostiarra sauce made from the classic San Sebastián style pil pil; and a charcoal grilled old beef loin, its rich flavours amplified by a smoked garlic mousseline and a drizzle of truffle jus. Accompanying these are inspired items such as a jelly of tomato essence served with a tomato sorbet and Japanese fruit and micro tomatoes, and a sea anemone served with bomba rice and sea succulents, finished with a fragrant chive aioli — further demonstrating the breadth and depth of Chef Aitor’s evolved and elevated repertoire.  \r\n\r\nComplementing the food is an expanded beverage list personally selected by General Manager Vincent Jaureguiberry. The industry veteran who has passed through the doors of Pierre Gagnaire in France and Saint Pierre Restaurant in Singapore looks beyond prized vintages and awards to find the true merit in good wines. He sees wines as expressions of the people behind each bottle, and takes the effort to meet the winemakers. As such, Basque Kitchen’s list of over 600 wines is a unique collection comprising of fine and rare wines from both prestigious houses and small producers. Each bottle also represents a moment in Vincent’s wine journey — and that of the restaurant’s wine service team.  \r\n\r\nSome highlights from the collection include a vintage juice made from an apple variety native to the Basque country, commissioned by the restaurant, a terroir-driven French Basque natural cider from Domaine Bordatto, exclusive to Basque Kitchen; and an exclusive vintage collection from Basque winery Artadi. Of note is also the Jean Louis Vergnon Champagne “Conversation”, a blanc de blanc produced especially for Basque Kitchen in the renowned Cote des Blanc, homeland of the oldest and most mineral Chardonnay. Patrons can also look forward to weekly vineyard highlights, with wines offered by the glass, to be introduced at a later stage.  \r\n\r\nOn the list is also an extensive range of sherries, from crisp Finos to nectar-like Pedro Ximenez. Connoisseurs will take delight in exquisite drops such as those from celebrated Andalusian sherry maker Bodegas Pérez Barquero. The Solera Fundacional 1905 and Solera Cincuentenario 1955 from the 116 year-old bodega are considered guardians of a classical, extraordinary style, and at Basque Kitchen sherry enthusiasts will have the opportunity to sample the Amontillado 1955 and Oloroso 1955 from the Solera Cincuentenario series of the house, amongst other noble selections. \r\n\r\n“Basque Kitchen by Aitor is a celebration of Basque heritage, but it is also a celebration of the hearts and minds of our team,” shares Chef Aitor. “Every dish is a loving tribute to my own grandmothers; and every bottle marks a personal moment in the wine journey of our sommeliers. We hope not just to intrigue you with an immersive gastronomic experience, but also touch your heart with every drop and morsel presented.” (Apr 2021)","images":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1619153601_31321.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1619153601_79790.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1619153602_27256.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1619153602_30846.jpg?date=202106080907"]},{"title":"Bayswater Kitchen","Cuisine":"Bar, Fusion, Seafood","Menus":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/05/1620016482_71649.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/03/1616130217_80952.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/1617771779_17810.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/1617771754_25933.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/1617615831_93434.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/03/1616384423_32569.pdf","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/05/1620728319_42308.pdf"],"Hours":"Tue-Thu: 11:30am-3pm (Last Order: 2:30pm), 6-10pm (Last Order: 9:30pm)Fri: 11:30am-3pm (Last Order: 2:30pm), 6-10.30pm (Last Order: 10pm)Sat & PH Eve: 6-10:30pm (Last Order: 10pm)Sun & PH: 11am-3:30pm (Last Order: 3pm), 6-10pm (Last Order: 9:30pm)Closed Monday","Price":"$$$","Good For":"Casual Dining, Kid Friendly, Private Functions, Quiet Dinner","Location":"Harbourfront","Address":"2 Keppel Bay Vista\r\nMarina At Keppel BaySingapore (098382)                                                Map","Address Link":"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1.2640047,103.8124338&query_place_id=ChIJrUMTruUb2jERZMClEggRrFE","DISHES WE LOVE":"Jumbo Crab Cakes, Lobster Bisque, Chef’s Seafood Platter, Braised Ox Cheek, Linguine Vongole, Margaret River Angus Grain-Fed Tenderloin","ABOUT":"Bayswater Kitchen offers informal, happy seafront dining with an approachable seafood-centric menu.\r\n \r\nLocated right by the waterfront at the scenic Marina at Keppel Bay, Bayswater Kitchen is a celebration of all things related to the sea, from the bountiful fresh produce to the laidback and relaxed atmosphere that being by the seaside inspires.\r\n\r\nFeaturing an extensive a la carte menu and bi-weekly set lunches that celebrates seasonality and freshness, Bayswater Kitchen introduces you to the simple pleasures of seafood cooked honestly yet creatively to enhance their inherent flavours and textures.

Here, there’s a full Italian menu including pastas and charcoal grilled meats, turned out by a highly-trained team of chefs drawn from top Italian restaurants all over the island. Dine alfresco to really soak up the Robertson Quay vibes, but also because pasta tastes better with a side of people watching - and you’ll be doing a lot of people watching, because one plate won’t be enough. Think chewy batons of Cavatelli pasta tossed with wilted spinach and salty Parma Ham or a bountiful Linguine Frutti de Mare, a garlicky toss-up of linguine and tender shrimp, clams, and squid. One of the highlights is a beautiful, generous portion of Pappardelle Boscoiala, ribbony strips of pasta in a rich, tomato-based mushroom sauce. Beyond pasta, fill up on their hefty charcoal grilled meats and seafood. A particularly attractive Grigliata Gamberi E Calamari sees smoky grilled squid and fleshy big prawn served with little other than a squeeze of lemon and their own juices with fresh arugula.\n\nRiver breeze, hot pasta, and the capable hands of an Italian kitchen - Singapore rarely gets better than this.

Grab a seat in the alfresco area and you could almost be on a Roman street, soaking up the sights, sounds, and, most importantly, smells. Here, the pizza is made fresh by hand in the Neapolitan style, meaning the crust has the perfect balance between chewiness and crispiness. That sweet spot is probably why the pizzas here are regularly touted amongst some of the best in town. Obviously it’s not just about the crust: imagine the sinful appeal of a pizza crowned by wobbly mounds of creamy Burrata cheese, or topped with an elegant fan of thinly sliced salmon on a bed of spinach. If all that’s too rich, reach for the bright flavours of anchovies, capers, and tomatoes in their Napoleon pizza, or the simple pleasures of Gorgonzola, browned onions, and Mozzarella in the Pizza Cipolla. There’s also pastas, like the especially indulgent Truffle-bomb, Fettuccine Salciccia Fe Tartufo, where noodles are tossed in a truffle cream, topped with freshly-shaved black truffle. It’s very hard to top the joy of pizza, but here it becomes an art.

This homely eatery serves up familiar, comforting flavours with plenty of homemade touches. \r\n\r\nThe Popiah Goreng, for instance, is an appetiser not to be missed. The vegetable spring rolls are made in-house, and deep-fried until crispy. Perfect for dipping into a house-made spicy chilli sauce. Another popular appetiser is the Daging Bungkus Kukus. This rare treat features a fluffy pancake, filled with juicy ground meat marinated with herbs and bathed in a housemade gravy, \r\n\r\nIf you’re craving a bowl of hot soup, be sure to try the restaurant’s signature Sup Ekor Sapi Bijian. This savoury soup is redolent with freshly ground spices, and chock-full of tender braised oxtail. For mains, Bijan serves a selection of Western and Malay classics, with the occasional fusion dish. The Spaghetti Rendang, for instance, is the perfect dish for diners who crave a little pasta, but still want to inhale the aroma and heartiness of beef rendang. \r\n\r\nFrom the wok, expect fluffy rice infused with Malay herbs over roaring flames. The smoke-kissed Traditional Kerabu Rice Bijan is packed with flavour, and served with crackers for garnish and strips of juicy beef. Also good from the Mains selection is the Gulai Lemak Daging Salai Dengan Jantung Pisang. Made the traditional way, this hearty stew features fresh banana flower cooked in a turmeric gravy, with slices of fork-tender chargrilled Australian sirloin. \r\n\r\nBe sure to save some space for dessert as well. The Banana Fritters with Coconut Ice Cream is a gourmand’s dream, where golden-brown sweet pillows of fruit are topped with a creamy coconut ice cream, and drizzled with a rich gula melaka. Order this one to share.

Inspired by a yakitori-ya in Osaka, the all-in-one Japanese yakitori restaurant by Chef Asai Masashi is a true find for more than one reason! \n\nHead down the Moh Guan Terrace alley and around the back of the unassuming Hua Bee stand to find a metal door with small, wiry Bincho lettering. Then down the rabbit hole you go, transitioning briskly from the traditional neighbourhood feel to the likes of an underground bunker, complete with rough edges, shady lighting, and oxidized copper tones. Take a seat at the marble bar for a front row seat to all the grilling action, or the domed booths to get your drink on, like the restaurant's most notable fruit, herb and sake-centric cocktails from the resident barkeep. With both food and drink menus largely in-flux at the whim of the chef and cocktailier, it's best to go with the daily recommendations.\n\nFood wise, get ready for a smoky experience of grilled goodness and smoky delights. With a menu inspired by the 24 micro-seasons in Japan, expect only the best produce of the season being featured on the menu. Available all year round, try the restaurant's famed protein - the tori (chicken), popular cuts like wings, breast and thighs masterfully executed over the bincho-tan charcoal.

Here, you’ll find every bit of chicken — from safer parts like thigh and wing, to the lesser-ordered neck and tail — grilled to charred perfection. This second Bincho outfit also has new menu items, such as the Uni Shabu Shabu. The light, creamy broth is infused with Japanese sea urchin, forming the base for an array of succulent seafood like prawns, oysters, and abalone. Get your daily dose of greens with the Yasai Maki (vegetable rolls), where wafer-thin slices of pork and beef are wrapped around yam, corn, and mushrooms, then grilled over an open flame.

The space is filled with natural light from two air-well openings, and hand-crafted art pieces and copper pipes are a chic finish to the walls here. \n\nBut the dishes here are far from the typical Eggs Benedict or pancake stack. Instead, the food is a delicious fusion of Western with Sichuan influences. Take the Yuxiang (fish fragrance). The sauce is traditionally made by frying doubanjiang, garlic and ginger with pickled chilli, served with meaty eggplants. At Birds of a Feather, the same dish comes with an extra layer of mozzarella cheese, and a generous sprinkle of mantou crumbs. \nIf you’re a big fan of spicy food, items like the Fortune Skewers are a must-order. This crowd favourite has gotten a new twist, and now comes with a fiery Sichuan red oil. Birds of a Feather specially pick their spices from Chengdu’s spice market, and these are laboriously  fried with chillies to create this house-made oil. \n\nNot all Sichuan dishes are numbingly spicy, either. The Sichuan Oxtail Soup is a light, clear broth, akin to the familiar pig’s trotters soup. Chinese herbs and fresh leek infuse this comforting soup with plenty of flavour. \n\nJust looking for a relaxed night out, with drinks and some simple grub? The street food-inspired selection is the perfect bar snack. Definitely order the Charcoal Grilled Pork Bits. Inspired by barbecued pork belly skewers sold along the streets, Birds of a Feather does a luxe version with Duroc pork belly, crispy rice crackers, charred green chilli, and Japanese sweet potato.

The new space brings together elements of Greek mythology and design along with Singapore's Chinese heritage and its colonial past. Stepping through the entrance, graced with two Mycaenian Lions, onto the black-and-white tiled floor and surrounded by the decorative Meander pattern, one isn't only transferred to Greece's rich ancient culture. The patterns also strike a familiar tone with designs seen in ancient China as well as Singapore's black-and-white houses.

The Southern Roasted Chicken is a favourite - chicken is marinated in a cornucopia of aromatic Thai herbs and spices, before being roasted till all the flavours are absorbed. Sink your teeth into a piece of the Southern Roasted Chicken, and you’ll be amazed at how heaven can exist on a plate! As for desserts, the Blue Mango Sticky Rice is a modern twist on a Thai classic.  Of course, the stars of the show are ripe and juicy mangoes. Butterfly pea flowers are used to colour the accompanying glutinous rice a bright, vibrant blue. Paired together, the sweetness of the mangoes is perfectly counterbalanced by the sharpness of the blue sticky rice - a timeless combination! What are you waiting for?

One-of-a-kind in terms of its compact dynamism, Buko Nero prides itself on serving food that they themselves would want to eat, if they were the customer. The wife, Tracy, who is Singaporean, handles the front of the restaurant, while the husband, Oscar, an Italian, is the chef. Together, they have created something that is semi-legendary in the Singapore dining scene because of the quality of food and the waiting list for this restaurant. \n\nTop of the list of recommendations for this unique establishment is the Buko Nero Tau Kwa Tower with sauteed vegetables and Asian dressing, which was created as a stacked dish consisting of vegetables such as parsley, carrots, and enoki mushrooms layered atop a big piece of tau kwa (firm tofu). Kecap manis (Indonesian sweet soya sauce) is drizzled over it, giving the entire concoction an extra oomph. Deceptively simple, this dish has won fans because of its unique flavour combination and freshness of vegetables used. The Baked Fillet of Cod, which is presented with a crust made of olives and a sweet bell pepper coulis, has also won praise for its simple yet effective use of basic ingredients. For cosy Italian fare in the heart of Singapore, it is hard to find a more intimate, homely dining experience than this well-loved restaurant that serves food straight from the heart.

In the tradition of a true mezza, begin with a sharing platter of some of the most beautiful hummus in town: topped with a party of pine nuts, herbs, minced lamb, and olive oil, this creamy hummus, eaten with crisp pita, is heaven on earth. Alongside that, a mezze platter of Babaganoush, Labneh, Moussaka, and Arabic Salad, gives you extra pita-dipping options, and all this before the main course of grilled meats. From fragrant, smoky Lamb Kofta to tender Shish Taouk (chicken breast in a zesty marinade), nothing speaks of the Middle East quite like its stunning array of grilled, marinated meats. But it’s the charcoal-grilled Lamb Chops, paired with spicy harissa, grilled vegetables, and rice that makes for a truly climactic moment: the smoky, meaty flavours are brought out perfectly by the zingy harissa, and the meat comes off the bone in chewy, tender bites.

With delicious bar bites and close to 100 different labels of gin sourced from across the globe, what's there not to love?\n\nThe bar food menu is tightly curated, while also maintaining multiple choices for vegetarians. The Truffle Fries are a surefire crowd-pleaser - delicious french fries are tossed with roasted garlic aioli, shaved parmesan and sliced truffles, resulting in a dish that is simply divine! The Gruyere Cheese Stuffed Mushrooms is another tempting delight. Button mushrooms are encrusted in panko crumbs, before premium gruyere cheese is melted all over it. Served with a roasted garlic aioli dip, this mouthwatering dish will be gobbled up before you know it. The Spicy Sriracha Buffalo Wings are a modern take on an old favourite. Breaded chicken wings are deep-fried and then dunked in the universally-beloved Sriracha Ketchup sauce till deliciousness oozes out of every bite.

The restaurants have amassed numerous accolades over the years, most notably the Singapore Prestige Brand Award for Most Popular Promising Brand. \n\nThe dishes here are both Instagram-worthy and delicious. The Charcoal Grilled Octopus Leg is a unique looking dish served on a wooden board with Potato Gratin and Romesco Sauce. Items on the Epicurean menu are a little moreish, and consist of a meat main, salad, and fries. These dishes are all under $20, which means that you can have a sumptuous meal without breaking the bank. Some of our favourite dishes include the Collins’ All-Day Brunch, which is a plate filled with brunch staples like bratwurst and sunny-side up. The Dry Aged Beef Burger is another crowd favourite. The patty is made of dry-aged beef and topped with honey baked ham, cheddar, and egg. \n\nDiners who are after something healthier and lighter will love the Grilled Chicken Salad. Generous chunks of grilled chicken breast are tossed with mesclun salad, tomatoes, and refreshing Japanese cucumber. The Grilled Jumbo Asparagus is excellent, and dipped in the Romesco sauce the dish is served with, it’s almost heavenly.

The brilliant minds behind some of our favourite cocktail spots such as Jigger & Pony, Sugarhall, and Gibson, have created an exciting dining concept that we absolutely adore.\r\nSituated in the historic Customs House by the uber-scenic waterfront, Caffe Fernet is a beautiful 130-seater establishment where Italian-inspired nibbles and drinks are served with style and flair. On good days, we prefer to opt for the casual and breezy alfresco dining area where we can sip on a drink while enjoying views of the Marina Bay skyline. \r\nThe food here promises to be fresh and exciting. Instead of the heavy, traditional Italian nosh, Caffe Fernet takes these tried-and-true Italian flavours and breathes into them fresh life. Indulge in delightful plates such as the minimalistic Cacio e Pepe that showcases nothing but freshly cracked black pepper and high-grade cheese. Looking for finger food instead? Then opt for the delightful morsels of Saffron Arancini or a bowl of Marinated Olives. And be sure to order up an evergreen cocktail such as a Spritz or Negroni that never goes out of style.  \r\nWhether you’re a food or cocktail aficionado, you won’t regret swinging by Caffe Fernet for a contemporary restaurant and bar experience done right.

Before the binge-drinking, line your stomach with the hearty Mexican fare on offer. Think soft corn tacos filled with tender red snapper, fatty pork carnitas, or shredded steak, perfect with a dash of salsa and pico de gallo. If you’re looking for something heftier, full plates are available too, featuring chow like a Mulato Rib Eye, a chargrilled cut of Australian beef that’s intensified with Mexican spices and a fiery chili sauce, served alongside beans and rice. The house specialty is the Green Chile Stew, made with pork in a rich broth of chile verde, served with tortillas and rice, for a hearty, spicy centrepiece that’s perfect for sharing. Take down the heat with an icy margarita, or a smoky Mezcal cocktail, and soak up the riverside vibes: the night is only beginning.

At Candlenut, this uniquely Southeast Asian cuisine is getting its time in the limelight thanks to chef-owner Malcolm Lee’s deft work and skill that garnered him a Michelin star two years in a row.  \n\nWith high ceilings, clean lines, and plenty of sunshine, it’s almost impossible to feel stressed in the relaxed and laidback atmosphere that Candlenut exudes. While this 92-seater establishment includes a private room for more intimate dinners, guests also have the option of sitting in the al fresco area for a night under the stars. \n\nThere are a fair number of classic Peranakan dishes on a menu that spans across 40 appetisers, mains, and desserts. Be prepared to fall head over heels for standouts such as the Red Lion Snapper, accompanied by fresh chilli sambal and charred garlic chives. The King Tiger Prawn, featuring local ingredients such as gula melaka coconut sauce, lemongrass, and Thai basil, is also another hit. Of course, indecisive eaters can always go for the playfully-named Ah-Ma-Kase tasting menu to sample a little of everything. \n\nWith a new home at the ultra-hip COMO Dempsey, Candlenut promises a night (or afternoon) filled with contemporary Straits-Chinese cuisine amid the lush greenery that is Dempsey Hill.

A lively Brazilian churrascaria is what you should seek for an eventful and delicious evening out. \n\nThe idea is simple. You sit down, and passadors bearing skewers of grilled premium meat, carve moist slivers directly onto your plate. Beef, chicken, lamb, fish – there's no need to limit yourself. It's an endless flow of meaty goodness where all you have to do is sit, and eat. And eat. And eat. Just when your palate is starting to feel a little jaded, you order a portion of grilled caramelised pineapple whose sharp, tangy sweetness is the perfect way to whet your appetite all over again. All so you can get back to those delicious cuts of meat. \n\nDon't just be dazzled by the succulent barbecued meats, rotisserie-cooked to perfection. There's also a buffet spread that shouldn't be overlooked! With staples like salads and pastas, it's where you should turn to if you feel that you've met your match on the protein front. \n\nThe meat though, is undeniably the draw of this restaurant, and with a name like Carnivore, that shouldn't be a surprise. \n\nStationed near the archways of the iconic CHIJMES pavilion, this Carnivore outlet is undeniably unique. Softened by the backdrop of the gorgeous white chapel, the outdoor dining option here is a must, creating an incomparable ambience that makes this unique dinner experience all the more special. So sharpen those claws and polish those canines my friends, because there's no better place to meet.

Its concrete floors, sleek furniture and two storey-foyers are modern, while mainstays of Italy are sprinkled about, with poppy Italian tunes playing and vintage photos of the restaurant's namesake singer dotting the wall.\nWhile the interiors exude an air of Southern Italy, the flavours from the dishes that fly out of the kitchens here will truly transport diners to the heart of Puglia at first bite. Start your meal right with La Burrata, Puglia’s renown burrata cheese with wild rocket and cherry tomatoes, or sink your teeth into the beautifully fresh and tart octopus salad Insalata Di Polipo. Follow that with famous lamb dishes that Puglia is famous for: the Pappardelle Con Ragu Di Agnello features slow braised lamb that’s cooked for 8 hours and served over homemade pasta, while Costolette Di Agnello Al Timo brings you gorgeous thyme-roasted lamb chops with artichokes, spinach, and roasted potatoes.\nWith the brilliant lightness of all the dishes, saving room for dessert isn't a concern.

Founded in Osaka in 1971, this historic restaurant pays homage to the beloved Japanese dumpling. The recipe was perfected by Kenzo Nishi and the basic ingredients have not been modified since. Every single dumpling is filled with the right amount of filling and is fried to crisp perfection without a hint of greasiness.\n\nThe gyoza here are stuffed with a variety of fillings and topped with everything from cheese to citrus sauce. Vegetarians will be glad to know that Cabbage Gyoza is also on the menu. Diners looking for a unique dish can try the Ponzu Buta Gyoza - a delicious serving of pork gyoza drenched in a citrus and ponzu sauce. The combination may sound off-putting to some, but don’t knock it till you’ve tried it.

We never thought a restaurant would be called this, ever. But ask any Singaporean and he or she will tell you that the chao ta, or “burnt” part of a meat dish is usually the best. There’s just something irresistible about the crispy black crust and smoky flavour. That nostalgic flavour is what the folks at this homely eatery aim to showcase in its array of chargrilled mains.\r\n\r\nTheir signature dish is the Pork Ribs, with grilled prime ribs that are crisp on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside. To add another dimension of flavour to the dish, it’s served with a homemade spicy dipping sauce and a wedge of lime. Another specialty is the Chaota Fu, an umami dish of deep-fried tofu topped with aburi mentaiko sauce, tobiko, and bonito flakes. Wash the goodness down with an ice-cold glass of their house-concocted Sake Mojito.\r\n\r\nThe desserts, which bring back old school flavours with a twist, are not to be missed either.

From searing soup bases to healthy stews, there’s something for everyone at this centrally-located spot.\n\nAdventurous patrons looking for the spiciest dish can refer to the number of chillies next to its name on the menu to gauge its spice level. Daredevils can start with the Secret Recipe Spring Frog, a delicious dish of chilli, frog meat, and a combination of secret sauces. The dish has a spicy, salty flavour that pairs perfectly with white rice. A little less ambitious? Start with the Griddle Cooked Trotters and work your way up.\n\nDiners who wish to steer clear of the spice will be glad to know that there is a wide variety of healthy soups available. The Duck Soup with Sour Radish is a simple dish that is easy on the digestive system is a touted to have a “cooling” effect on the body. For something a little moreish, opt for the Chengdu Style Trotter Soup. This dish is richer due to the use of pork, and comes with a serving of vegetables.

A scallop har gow, for instance, is not just a plump sliver of scallop wrapped in a starchy white parcel. Instead, you’ll find your ‘dim sum’ presented as a light, fluffy scallop mousse, piped onto a hotate shell with a layer of crab bisque. There’s something new to discover each time you have dinner at Chinoiserie. Chef Justin Quek is no stranger to fine dining cooking, and he’s taken his knowledge of French techniques and married it with his penchant for Asian flavours. \r\n\r\nMenus here are prix fixe or a la carte, and you’ll find seasonal ingredients like French Challan ducks and Manjimup black truffles. But rather than roasted in their own fat, the gamey ducks, are tossed in a wok and cooked over roaring flames to medium rare. Vegetables like artichokes and asparagus are stir-fried Asian-style, rather than served as a Western salad. \r\n\r\nPopular favourites here include a wild coral cod fillet, seared till the scales are crispy and served in a sweet-sour sauce, as well as French poussin stuffed with claypot rice. Leave room for the desserts — the banana flambé in rum and salted gula java ice cream is a great way to end an ever interesting meal.

Chuan Hung or ‘Sichuan Alley’ focuses wholeheartedly on one particular Sichuan ingredient known as Mian Yang rice noodles. At Chuan Hung, these noodles are served the way they have always been for millennia: with a choice of different broths, and a variety of toppings such as braised beef and pig intestines.\r\nChuan Hung’s rice noodles are, admittedly, a little more distinctive: they are specially sourced from one particular artisan who lives in a village deep in Sichuan. Research for months into about 50 different Sichuan noodle shops led the Chuan Hung team to understand that only one particular shop sold the exact type and style of Mian Yang noodles that they wanted to present to Singaporeans – but it took close to a year and dozens of personal trips to the shop in sincere appeal before the owners finally softened and agreed to speak to them. It took even longer to research and try the different noodles the artisan made: every detail was examined, down to the gauge of the noodles in millimetres.The noodles now served in Chuan Hung are customised for the noodle house, and found nowhere else in Singapore or South East Asia. The noodles may be ordered with the clear or red soups as well as the uniquely Sichuan mix of red and clear. In addition, Chuan Hung also offers a third broth option: a deceptively clear soup that is piquantly infused with Sichuan vine pepper, and a dry-tossed version. Those with bigger appetites can feel free to order “add-ons” as extra toppings for the noodles, and a curated selection of small plates – archetypal Sichuan sides such as Fried Crispy Pig Intestines and Braised Eggplant – as accompaniment.\r\nThe interiors of Chuan Hung is deserving of attention from the diner as well. Located in a side alley just off the far busier main street in much the same way that noodle shops in China have been set up for years, Chuan Hung is a little haven of gently coloured wood, bamboo furnishings and warm lighting. The small space of half a dozen tables – bustling when full, and tranquil when quiet – is inspired by the aforementioned noodle shops though elevated with thoughtful design details to ensure comfort for the guest even at the busiest of times.

The structure is a sight to behold: through an ancient Chinese gateway with giant roaring lions guarding either side of its doors lies the Chui Huay Lim Club. Founded in 1845 as a place for prominent Teochew families to meet, you wouldn't guess the site's 166-year history from the brand new building that just opened in October.\nThe home of Singapore's oldest Teochew community club, you can be sure that dining at Chui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine restaurant is one of the most authentic Teochew experiences possible. Run by the JUMBO Group of Restaurants, the food here has been refined to perfection by the keen eyes of generations of critical Teochew matriarchs. Classic dishes range from Cold Crab to Braised Duck, but for variety you'll also find some familiar favourites like Boiled Live Prawns and Chilli Crab. The seafood comes from tanks lining the restaurant, and was some of the best steamed pomfret the Chope Team has ever had. The house specialty though is clearly the Teochew Style Roasted Suckling Pig, which multi-generations seem to flock to the restaurant for day after day.\nChui Huay Lim Teochew Cuisine offers traditional cuisine in a comfortable and tasteful setting - a must-try dining experience for your entire family, and you don't even need to be a member of the club!

Perennial favourites include the heaping Our Big Raw Salad, which features a guilt-free indulgence of fresh and raw fruits and vegetables. There are a number of featured dishes inspired by the Indian subcontinent, such as the crunchy Samosas stuffed with spiced lamb and topped with a sweet and tangy mango chutney. Or opt for the Lamb Kofta, which has a hint of smokiness from the tandoor that’s fired by coconut charcoal. To make dining a family-friendly affair, the restaurant shies away from predictable kids’ menus. Instead, COMO Cuisine encourages young diners to expand their palates by choosing any dish that is served in a smaller portion. \n\nDesigned by Italian architect and designer, Paola Navone, COMO Cuisine’s decor is a stunning interplay of light and elegant elements to make you feel comfortable and relaxed.

Finally, with the lifting of dining-in restrictions on 19 June, Corner House is thrilled to reopen to the public with a daringly original new menu that showcases its prowess in contemporary seasonal cuisine.\r\nSince its opening in 2014, Corner House has earned multiple recognitions including the award of one-Michelin-star since 2016 and a rise to #42 on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants 2020 list. The\r\nappointment of French-Chinese-Mauritian David Thien ushers in a fresh perspective as he debuts an exploratory world of fine flavors, inspired by his adopted home of Singapore since 2007.\r\nThe eagerly anticipated new menu at Corner House showcases intimate sessions where Chef Thien prepares dishes inspired by personal stories, thoughts, and memories. The dining experience is designed to inspire and surprise. He elaborates, “My hope is that guests develop a deeper\r\nappreciation and connection with the food that they eat, relishing the thought behind it.”\r\nThe menu continues to be organized by three, five, and seven-course sets for lunch, and five, seven, and chef’s course for dinner. Guests are presented with chapters authored by chefs, detailing stories\r\naccompanied by visuals that delve into each ingredient or concept. The menu is dynamic and everchanging to adapt to the seasons, sources, and customers.

Meats here are sliced to order and sold by weight, so you can have as much or as little as you like of that fall-off-the-bone goodness. Look forward to a meaty affair with Decker’s delicious Brisket, Spare Ribs, Buffalo Wings, and Chopped Beef. There is no bad choice here - the perfectly smoked meats are tender, juicy, and bursting with flavour. On weekends, treat yourself with the Pork Belly Burnt Ends and the aptly-named Dinosaur Rib, a succulent 600-gram bone-in beef short rib. The sandwich combos are also worthy of mention, and our favourite has got to be the “Big Daddy” Fried Chicken, where a chunky piece of crispy fried chicken is piled high with slaw, jalapenos, and barbecue sauce and slapped between two plump buns.\n\nAmp up your meat order with classic all-American side dishes made in-house daily such as the Brisket Beans (barbecue baked beans and smoked brisket), mouthwatering Cornbread, and of course,  Mac ‘N Cheese.

Founded by a couple in 1988 with the aim of bringing the best of North Indian cuisine to Singapore, Delhi’s Restaurant has grown from strength to strength and now operates in two locations in Little India - on Serangoon and Race Course Road. If the posh saffron and wood interior isn’t enough to entice you in, the smells from the kitchen certainly will. Think spicy masala and freshly cooked naan. With friendly servers and an excellent array of dishes, it’s easy to see why the pioneering Indian eatery has built up a loyal following over the last three decades. \r\n\r\nThe Romali Roti is a must-try. Translated to mean “handkerchief bread” this unique dish is made in an overturned wok to give it its delicate texture. The roti is paper-thin and soaks up the flavour of any curry that it is dipped into, making it the perfect accompaniment to the many curries on offer here. The Fish Curry is a great option for diners who are tired of the diluted versions offered at other restaurants. The curry is robust and spicy, and is best enjoyed with some steamed rice or naan bread to soak up all the flavour.

With blue-tiled walls and oud music in the air, you’d be forgiven for thinking you were in Ankara when you first enter this restaurant. The smell of fresh flatbread and stews, as well as the welcoming atmosphere of this restaurant make this the perfect place for a hearty meal with family and friends.\n\nThe Patlican Musakka is a classic Turkish item that is not to be missed. Made with chicken or lamb, eggplant, potato, and topped with a generous helping of cheese, this rich dish is baked in a claypot for maximum flavour. Earthy, buttery, and delectable, this is an absolute must-try for diners who are new to Turkish cuisine. If you’re looking for a Turkish take on a classic dish, look no further than the Pasta Carbonara. Made with some additional herbs and spices and without the addition of bacon, this is a Middle Eastern rendition of the classic Italian dish and just as good as the original.","PRESS RELEASE":"","images":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Beyti_Edite_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Restaurant__1539775243.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Baklava_Edi_1539775243.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Falafel_1_E_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Firin_Sutla_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Patlican_Mu_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Indoor_Edit_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2018/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_Derwish_Turkish_Testi_Kebab_1539775244.jpg?date=202106080907"]},{"title":"Di Wei Teochew Restaurant","Cuisine":"Chinese, Seafood, Zi Char","Menus":"","Hours":"Mon-Sun: 11am-2:30pm, 5:30-10pm","Price":"$$$","Good For":"Business Meetings, Casual Dining, Kid Friendly, Quiet Dinner","Location":"Seletar","Address":"1 The OvalSingapore (797859)                                                Map","Address Link":"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1.4073864,103.8679714&query_place_id=ChIJSwKbziwU2jERXuYff9DaHiI","DISHES WE LOVE":"Teochew Cold Crab, Liver Roll, Prawn Balls, Pork Rib Yam Ring and Yam Paste with Gingko Nuts or Pumpkin","ABOUT":"A heartwarming cuisine that  fills the stomach and soul, Teochew food is the culinary balm we need on cold rainy days. And when the craving for this notable cuisine hits, there’s no better place to go than Di Wei Teochew Restaurant. This humble eatery, which first opened its doors in 2014 at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, has now expanded to a grand colonial bungalow that’s located in Seletar Aerospace Park. \n\nSit around one of the restaurant’s round table and be amazed by the seemingly endless amounts of food that Chef Khoo Tai Guan and his team puts out. The menu at this restaurant is built around lightly-flavoured delicacies made from only the freshest ingredients the kitchen staff can buy. If you come here on any given day, don’t be surprised to see dishes such as the Teochew Cold Crab, deep-fried Prawn Balls, or crispy Pork Rib Yam Rings flying out of the kitchen doors. Craving something more luxurious? Then be sure to give the Crayfish Porridge or the Pomfret Porridge a try. \n\nAt Di Wei, Chef Khoo takes the classic and cherished Teochew dishes and modernizes them for the new generation.

Timber furniture, carved wooden screens, red cloth aplenty, you half expect an epic fight to break out in Dian Xiao Er, with kungfu kicks and wine barrels flying around.\n\nExcept the only fight one can imagine here is over the famous Herbal Roasted Duck that has been the mainstay of the Dian Xiao Er menu for the last 12 years. The dark herbal gravy that the duck comes bathed in is made of 10 Chinese herbs that include codonopsis root, foxglove root, and licorice root. This gravy is said to have a calming effect while relieving mental stress and revitalizing energy. We were definitely very energized after eating this duck, not least because of its succulence and moistness. The duck skin itself is also crispy and adds a satisfying crunch to the dish. Paired with fragrant steamed rice, the flavours of this dish are strong, but not overpowering. \n\nTry the other dishes on the menu as well; Dian Xiao Er specializes in traditional Chinese comfort food such as melt-in-the-mouth Dong Po Pork and refreshing Silver Cod Fish in Superior Soy Sauce. For a taste of traditional Chinese inn food, Dian Xiao Er is the place to go.

There’s also an Artisanal Cheese Platter to go with the bright, robust wines on offer from the shelves. \n\nMains here come in the form of smoky grilled meats. Think hearty steaks like the Grilled Ribeye served with a medley of seasonal vegetables and red wine jus, or the New Zealand Rack of Lamb served up with French ratatouille and a salad of puffed rice. Other mains take a more British gastropub turn, with a Classic Fish & Chips, featuring beer battered Sea Bass, and Bangers & Mash made with fatty Kurobuta Pork Toulouse Sausages, crowning the menu. Dessert is a classic Chocolate Lava Cake affair, though you should also get the Raspberry Dome, an elegant, tangy confection, and make a double-dessert night of it.

Offering up waterfront dining, the restaurant boasts an excellent view of the Singapore River. A theme of mixing old and new flows throughout the restaurant and nicely echoes the design philosophy of the museum. It's contemporary interior and vibrant décor contrasts with the colonial facade, and diners will surely enjoy the juxtaposition of casual dining whilst nestled in the confines of a formal museum.\r\nThis trend continues with the menu. EMPRESS features dishes that are a mainstay of Cantonese cuisine but does so in a way that blends good ole' Cantonese flavours with more modern touches. Don't worry, you'll still be able to recognize items from dim sum to their signature roast meats. Speaking of which, the Triple Roast Platter, which showcases Spare Ribs, Char Siew, and Roast Pork, all of which are carefully cooked to retain that perfect level of juiciness, is a team favourite! EMPRESS is also one of the first few restaurants in Singapore to give an Asian-slant to Impossible Meat – the Impossible Meat Gyozas and Kway Teow are truly delicious.

The charming nautical-themed decor and handsome wooden touches throw you straight into a seafaring fantasy right in the middle of King Albert Park. It’s the perfect mid-shopping getaway for those tired feet and hunger pangs: expect comforting nosh and hearty cafe grub, alongside an invigorating cup of strong coffee. Except this isn’t your usual cafe fare. There’s a healthy amount of kitchen wizardry at work here. Think of hefty appetizers like their signature Treasures in a Bun, a pillowy steamed bun stuffed with slow-braised pork belly done up with caramelized ginger chili sauce and crunchy fried shallots. This is matched with fiery Thai-influenced salads like the Pomelo Pick Me Up, a salad of tender poached prawns tossed in a zingy sweet chili lime dressing, dressed with peanuts, and scattered with tart pomelo gems for a true party in the mouth.\nMains here go straight to comfort food territory with numbers like the Lobster Submarine, a buttery roll filled with poached lobster that’s dressed with lemony mayo, crunchy tobiko, and crunchy vegetables. For something even heftier, and more indulgent, get the Foie Gras Wagyu Burger, which hits all the luxury eating sweet spots: meltingly fatty foie gras crowns a juicy Wagyu patty that’s sandwiched between fluffy brioche buns and held together by a lovely onion marmalade and mushrooms. If there’s room for dessert, the Chocolate Cherry Dome, a beautiful confection of chocolate, berries compote, strawberries, and meringue, will seal the deal on your visit. Pop by for their High Tea too for tiers of similarly elegant desserts and a quiet afternoon in one of the city’s most charming neighbourhoods.

Located just steps from the iconic Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, this eatery has a menu that could easily convert any carnivore. The restaurant’s motto, meatless does not mean tasteless, is echoed in many of the menu items, which are made with plant-based meat alternatives that are just as good, if not better than the original.\n\nThe Marmite Vegetarian Pork Ribs are a chef specialty, and made with soy and yeast extract. While it may not sound very appealing, the combination of rich soy meat and earthy Marmite makes for a delectable combination - perfect as a snack or as an accompaniment to some freshly steamed jasmine rice.\n\nAnother dish worth trying is the Vegetarian Peking Duck. The clever use of fresh yam fried to crisp perfection to make the “duck meat” and the delicious taste of the of the dish itself are enough to convince you that you’re chowing down on real meat. Hankering for some treasures of the sea? Fret not, as they’ve got that on the menu as well. Try the Thai Sauce Cod Fish - a spicy sour dish of mock fish meat doused in a Thai-inspired dressing.

But with nightlife legends like Employees Only leading the charge, there’s very little to complain about. Loved by night owls in New York for its kooky, offbeat service, strong classic cocktails, and delicious comfort food, this West Village institution is now in Singapore, headed by one of the original bosses, the affable Igor Hadzismajlovic. Employees Only’s Singapore outpost is the bar’s first such international undertaking, and has landed at swish Amoy Street, to join the belt-of-sin’s constellation of upmarket speakeasies.\nPast the friendly door-keeps, you’re greeted by a surly, turban-wearing fortune teller (don’t ask) before you go through velvet curtains into a Moulin-Rouge-esque carnival of raucous chatter, Motown, and the chaotic sounds of a busy bar. The crowd is one of the friendliest in town, standing-room only on the best of nights with plenty of good booze to keep conversations going. Sip on one of the bar’s superb classic Manhattans as you scoot over to your table and sit down to a supper of comforting favourites like the joint’s famous Bone Marrow Poppers and Hand Cut Steak Tartare. Earlier in the night, dinner plates include a Roasted Half Chicken adorned with cauliflower, capers, and parsley, a tender Porterhouse Pork Chop with black eyed peas and savoy cabbage, and a grilled Whole Rainbow Trout.\nBut with accolades including Spirited Awards’ “World’s Best Cocktail Bar”, Employees Only Singapore guides your focus to the well trained bar-team, led by veteran bartender Steve Schneider, which turns out classic cocktails and new signatures made from a hefty selection of boutique spirits, house-made syrups, tinctures, and other goodies. Employees Only is all good: the vibes, the food, the drink, and, employees or not, we’re glad it’s in Singapore!

Therefore it’s no surprise that the menu here consists of hearty local comfort food such as the Singapore Style Chilli Prawns, Grandma's Te Kah Bee Hoon, and XO White Fish Soup.\r\n\r\nThe Curry Chicken is a must-try. The chicken is cooked in a special blend of spices till it is tender enough to fall off the bone, giving the dish a richness that is reminiscent of zi char stalls in the olden days. The Grandma's Te Kah Bee Hoon is a great option for diners who love hawker food. Made with thin stands of vermicelli tossed in a smoky, savoury homemade sauce, and topped with a generous portion of melt-in-your-mouth braised pork, this is the perfect dish to warm you up on a cold day.

With nostalgic Spanish kitchen curios and rough-hewn textures, the final product is a modern depiction of an urban canteen in Seville.\nEsquina has seen two chef changes since its founding, but the tradition of strong flavours and Spanish flair continues on with Executive Chef Carlos Montobbio. Born in Barcelona, the 28 year old has over ten years of experience despite his youth, including time spent in Michelin-starred restaurants, which accounts for the sophistication of the food and plating.\nWhile the second storey offers a quieter and equally quaint setting, you might prefer to sit around the frenetic open kitchen on the ground floor to marvel at the works of art being created not two feet away. Perfectly tender Grilled Spanish Octopus, the deceptively plain-sounding Spanish Omelette, and more unique Wagyu Beef Intercostals are just a few of the delicious plates you can find on the six-sectioned menu. The tiny digs may leave you without a seat if you haven't made a reservation, but Esquina is definitely worth the wait.

In doing so, Chef Jason radically departs from the foundational ‘mother sauces’ of French haute cuisine, thus blazing the trail for further innovation.

The restaurant has just the fitting look, with zany motifs reminiscent of Picasso, materialized as if from a dreamscape. Pepper grinder light fixtures and super-sized sculptures of familiar faces float above the dining space. A vintage motorcycle adorns the walls, and the food too has a quirky appearance that eclipses the unexpectedly classic flavours. Jubany introduces Catalan folk cuisine, and with a wave of the wand, adds brilliant Asian twists.\nThe black Mediterranean paella is filling yet nuanced in taste, and the patatas bravas and tomato bread both show a different side of the traditional tapas dishes. On the more Asian end of the spectrum, the Thai razor clams are delightfully piquant, while the roasted duck with orange zest dumplings show the chef's hubris in remaking local favourites. The varied menu even includes gluten-free options like the chocolate hamburger, a dessert indicative of the humourous approach FOC takes to dining.\nFrom the bar, brilliantly innovative cocktails are not in short supply. The menu is a clear demonstration of Nocentini's flexing of his creative muscles, using such unique ingredients as Matcha powder, cornflakes vodka, and galangal rum (though not all in the same drink).\nIf the name of the restaurant sounds like the slip of the tongue could be a dangerous one, it’s not an unintentional coincidence. Meaning fire in Catalan, FOC certainly plays with fire both in its name, its daring dishes, and its unapologetically unconventional approach to nouveau dining.

Cooked with a deliciously tantalising honey glaze atop a slab of tender pork meat, this dish is juicy, mildly sweet, and is best enjoyed warm. The Roasted Char Siew is another option that is perfect for seasoned connoisseurs. The meat is flame-grilled for maximum flavour, giving it a slick glaze and smoky flavour.\n\nNot a fan of pork? The Fook Kin Tofu is a silken tofu dish topped with salmon roe and cooked with traditional spice and sauces. This dish is tender, flavourful, and best enjoyed with a bowl of steamed rice. For something a little crunchier, opt for the Golden Lotus Root Chips - thin slices of lotus root fried to crisp perfection.

But, head to Famous Treasure for a taste of lesser-known dishes that are a nod to Singapore’s melting pot of cultures. Dinner starts with little saucers of tangy pickled papaya and sour plum-infused tomatoes that are meant to whet your appetite for the savoury plates to come. A dish of Steamed Empress Chicken is a well-loved Cantonese favourite. The fresh, plump chicken is lightly salted and steamed, drizzled with Shaoxing wine and soya sauce, then garnished with julienned ginger for a hint of heat. Also, try the Whole Steamed Fish with sour preserved vegetables, peanuts, and roast pork in a brown sauce for an uncommon pairing of ingredients.\r\n\r\nCarbs are a must-have at every Chinese restaurant, and the Teochew-style Kway Teow Fried with Chye Poh and Kai Lan is a humble dish redolent with wok hei (a complex, charred aroma). The flat rice noodles are tossed with preserved radish and chopped Chinese broccoli, then skillfully cooked at high heat over roaring flames for that deep, smoke-kissed flavour. \r\n\r\nApart from its extensive food menu, Famous Treasure also offers a vast selection of wines and whiskies, including limited editions such as a Balvenie 30-year-old Scotch as well as a 30-year-old Glenglassaugh.

If you want something more, go all out for indulgent French classics like the Burgundy Escargots Baked in Garlic Herb Butter, or Pan-Seared Foie Gras With Apple Chutney and Blinis. \r\n\r\nMeat-lovers are in for a treat at Farangse, which leans towards a beef-centric menu. Tuck into the Braised Beef Cheek with Red Wine and Mushrooms, a flavourful dish where the meat is simmered in a rich wine sauce until fork-tender and paired with earthy mushrooms, for a treat. Steaks are also done well in this French-Issan outfit, with crowd favourites such as grass-fed beef striploin and tenderloin char-grilled to perfection and served with a dollop of silky mash. Another favourite is the grilled iberico pork, dressed in lashings of honey and sweet roasted vegetables on the side. Be sure to save some space for dessert as well - the warm apple tart with a scoop of house-made vanilla ice cream is reminiscent of grandma’s cooking. For a fusion sweet treat, go for the Thai mango sticky rice.

Find yourself enamoured by a la carte options and set menus filled with incredibly detailed French classics like Le Homard (poached Maine lobster, fork mashed ratte potatoes, chives, bisque jus, and basil oil), L'agneau (8 hour slow cooked Lamb rump with garlic, Green peas, organic carrots, and rosemary lamb sauce), and Les Saint-Jacques (pan seared scallops, mushrooms, arugula, Parma ham, and chicken jus).

Flying Monkey will offer diners delectable dishes of contemporary pan-Indian cuisine served tapas style, as well as classic international cocktails with an Indian twist on flavours. As the only full-fledged kitchen and bar situated amidst the bustle of Bussorah Street, Flying Monkey is also one of the few restaurants in the vicinity to have bespoke cocktails available.\n\nTheir best-selling small plate dish is the Galouti Kebab ($14). The word 'Galouti' means to melt in one's mouth, and this dish truly lives up to its name.This was achieved by mincing the meat no less than 13 times, then marinating the meat with certain spices and unripe papaya.\n\nOther tapas signature dishes include Tandoori Chicken ($10) marinated in yogurt and spices; Tulsi Cod ($15) or Cod Fillet marinated with basil creating a greenish hue charred in the Tandoor; Calamari 65 ($10), a spin on 'Chicken 65' that is relished in Indian cuisine and would complement their cocktails well; and crispy Truffle Naan ($14) served with paneer mousse and pear chutney.\n\nBig Plate highlights include Quail Musallam ($26), which features a whole quail slow-cooked and served on Kashmiri Pulao, and Nalli Gosht ($26), which is a lamb shank cooked overnight and bathed in a creamy peanut-cashew curry served with garlic naan.\nFor dessert, diners can enjoy Jalebi ($10), a traditional crispy Indian Pretzel dipped in aromatic syrup. Freshly made from the kitchen, it  is served warm and topped off with a sprinkle of Pistachio.

With such quality seafood on offer, diners will most certainly be getting a bang for their buck. And as for the oft-asked question ‘to visit or not to visit’, for us it’s a real no-brainer!

Fair warning though, if you’re expecting the healthy type of yong tau foo with plenty of soup and boiled ingredients, turn back now. Their best-selling version of yong tau foo involves deep frying the typical tofu and meat options till they turn deliciously golden, before you slurp it all down with a bowl of thick vermicelli noodles and signature braised mushroom gravy. Alternatively, the ingredients can be boiled but, if you’d like to have your calories and eat healthy too, stick to deep frying and add a portion of vegetables instead.\nMid-afternoon is when the yong tau foo disappears but their Asian-inspired tapas won’t leave you missing it too much.

The accompanying peanut sauce and acar make the grilled snack perfect with a cold beer. The Chicharron & Chorizo Mixt is a great option for diners who love meat.

Here at modern-Cantonese restaurant, Full of Luck Restaurant, you’d be hard-pressed to imagine Cantonese food coming out of the kitchen. Beautiful, homely with earth tones, the space welcomes everyone with inventive Chinese family cuisine. The two-storey shophouse interiors have been designed to exude the familiarity of home with a twist. A mixture of vintage materials like rattan weave, terrazzo and teak wood have been juxtaposed with contemporary detailing and open space planning. The look makes perfect sense, given the menu’s lineup of progressive, contemporary Cantonese dishes and Chinese-inspired cocktails. It’s less Chinese restaurant than it is, well, a chill Cantonese cocktail bar.\r\n\r\nThe chef’s signature Honey Glazed Char Siew is a specialty here with melt-in-the-mouth pieces of Char Siew blowtorched over sugar to give a sweet crisp exterior. Other dishes include a selection of Dancing Rice (aka ‘pao fan’) – dancing fried rice crisps in sizzling hot fragrant broth filled with poached rice and fresh toppings. Other family favourites are the Braised Garoupa with Beancurd in claypot and the tender Herbal Emperor Chicken with Collagen. Indulgence comes in the form of the classic Beef Hor Fun with an aromatic truffled twist. Classic Cantonese food, shot-through with local zhi char flavours, is given a bold, contemporary twist.

And though many restaurants start out with such good-hearted intentions - recalling sustainable sourcing, organic harvesting, and no artificial preserving - the results are often less satisfactory to both the palate and wallet. Based on the buzz generated by GRUB since opening, and its bubbling-over space located off the beaten path in Bishan Park however, GRUB has nailed it. The window-encased space lends an eco-friendly vibe to the otherwise urban-hip decor. The mingling of hungry diners with park goers on the al fresco patio is the vision of peace, love and good eats.\nAnd quite tasty eats they are. The lion's share of the menu is dedicated to burgers of every sort - typical grub if there was one. Beef burgers are made from 100% grass-fed hormone-free beef, which is freshly ground in-house, a distinction you can taste in the moisture content and firmness of the patties. The juicy chicken burgers use antibiotic-free poultry as well. For vegetarians, the Portobello Burger subs the patty for a meaty mushroom cap topped with creamy crumbled feta, fresh lettuce and tomatoes. The combination is simplistic and satisfying.\nOf the signature dishes, the Mentaiko Fries are a must-try, featuring crispy shoestring fries crowned with marinated roe of pollock, and sprinkled with confetti of nori seaweed for a umami textural play that's truly unique. Another play on trendy Japanese flavours of the moment is the Sakura Ebi Linguine with crispy fried Sakura Ebi, tiger prawns and a hint of mentaiko.

The Patatas Bravas is another one to try, bringing with it all the satisfaction that deep-fried food can inspire – comforting and very much a Spanish dish, try not to gorge it all down too quickly!\n\nThe paellas are also a tasty option; do have a go at the hearty Seafood Paella with Calamari, Shrimps and Urchin, and relish the generous helpings of seafood. The restaurant also does lovely meat dishes, and you’ll adore the Pig Trotter Catalan Style with Turnips, a decadent and oh-so-delicious main if there ever was one. Finally, top off your meal with an Orange Ice-cream Soufflé, which will wow you with a light, zesty flavour that’s ideal for this tropical climate.

Each dish has one ingredient at the center of the flavor experience. While the presentations are at times a contrast of colorful and complex textures, Marco’s dishes create a balance of supporting flavors, similar to how supporting artists dance in harmony, in the background of the leading act.\nThis philosophy is pushed to its boundaries at Guccio, with critics sometimes claiming that a blindfolded customer would always be able to recognize the chief ingredients in the dish she is eating. This style won chef Marco a Bib Gourmand from the prestigious Michelin Star Guide for\ntwo years in a row, in 2016 and 2017.\nChef Marco welcomes you to his restaurant. Its décor is, once again, balanced and aims to be comfortable, while remaining in the background. At Guccio, customers will be at the center of the experience, with the colors and design elements to balance the surroundings. In the background of Marco’s main culinary signature style, Guccio will further differentiate itself by taking its diners onto a seasonal journey across the various regions of Italy, their fertile lands and their precious seas. At regular intervals, aligned with the four seasons of Europe, chef Marco will explore regional ingredients and recipes associated to each season, a unique opportunity to visit Italy even when 10,000 km away from it.\nMarco’s creation will be paired by the best Italian wine labels available. As for the culinary ingredients, Guccio will not focus so much on education about new ingredients or unknown brands, but on outright enjoyment of the best that Italy has to offer.

It is a world of opulence, yet with a certain earnest simplicity and elegance. The Art Nouveau-inspired decor, with its highly stylised flowing, curvilinear designs of fauna and floral motifs, is stunning but not overwhelming, gorgeous without being showy. While the restaurant boasts furniture pieces from luxury brands, the overall sense one gets is of warmth and welcome.\nThis sense of elegant simplicity is evident in the menu as well. Gunther’s fans will undoubtedly be familiar with signature dishes like the Cold Angel Hair Pasta that has earned the restaurant accolade after accolade since its opening. The Oscietra caviar is delicately scented with truffle, which marries the flavours of the dish together perfectly. The delectably crispy Suckling Pig with Kriek Beer Sauce is yet another favourite. While the dish itself is evocative of wedding dinners, come prepared to be amazed by the range of savoury flavours that is packed into Gunther’s rendition. Other carefully thought-out creations such as the Carpaccio of Wagyu Beef “Tartare” style are also delightful. The meat is served with crispy potato – a beautiful contrast against the marbled Wagyu beef. Likewise, the Floating Island of Champignon de Paris on Consommé of Poultry is a magical concoction with the rich taste of egg yolk and mushrooms in every mouthful.\nApart from signature desserts like the delicious Fine Apple Tart “à la dragées” with Havana rum raisin ice cream or the warm soufflé with daily flavours, Gunther’s whimsical dessert creations are worth a try. Choose from 350 labels of wine to end your meal on a high -- it will be a suitably simple and elegant way to toast to an equally exquisite gastronomic experience.

Japanese appetisers and snacks are also available for diners who wish to dine on something a little lighter. The Choregi Salad is a mix of greens, cucumber, and mushrooms, and is a perfect accompaniment to the large menu of meat available. The Chicken Caesar Salad is also a must-try. Made with greens, spiced chicken, and cranberries and walnuts for an sweet crunch, this dish is refreshing and the perfect way to start your meal here.\n\nThe meat selection is one of the widest available islandwide. Along with the aforementioned Kagoshima Wagyu, there is also Wagyu Kurubi, Kurobuta Pork, and Pork Belly in a variety of seasonings, including miso for an authentic umami taste and chilli oil for an extra kick. There is also a wide seafood selection - with fresh king prawn, scallops and squid available for grilling. \n\nStill feeling peckish after your meal? Opt for some ramen - Gomanegi Ramen is a popular choice. Tonkotsu ramen with egg and cha shiu, this dish is perfect to wash down the meat-heavy dishes from the barbecue.

Some of its other signature dishes include Fried Prawns with Cereal, Crispy Baby Squid and Golden Egg Salted Prawns.\nHaving built a name and an excellent reputation, JUMBO has since expanded with numerous outlets dotted across the island. Moreover, each outlet has its own distinctive menu in addition to the brand's signature dishes. It is little wonder that customers are encouraged to make reservations, or as Singaporeans would say, \"CHOPE\" seats before heading down, especially on Fridays and the weekends.\nIf there is anything that should be remembered about JUMBO Seafood, it should be its consistent quality, excellent service and undeniably fresh seafood.

Depending on your preference, they come plated on sourdough or multigrain buns. Not a fan of bread? Then go for the low-carb “naked” burger where your buns are substituted with lettuce and vegetables. A number of interesting ingredients span the menu so you won’t see a boring run-of-the-mill cheeseburger here. We’re especially fond of the ELSÄSSER Burger, which comes topped with brie and cranberries. Vegetarians and vegans won’t feel left out either, as this burger joint spins up a jaw-droppingly wide array of burgers well suited for every eater.

The Horntrager is a good way to show off how delicious going vegetarian can be, with a walnut pattie topped with crumbly feta cheese and a sweet fig jam.

This Singapore outpost, established in 1990, has the added advantage of being somewhat of an institution amongst late-night revelers at the lively Cuscaden area, a mix of interesting characters, a diverse mix of folks from die-hard rockers to curious tourists, all seeking the restaurant-bar's hearty food, hard-rocking local bands, and the raunchy humour of its resident standup comics.\nThe memorabilia is what keeps the Hard Rock family united across the world, but put that aside for a second and consider the grub. Think American dive bar with a little upmarket touch: chicken tenders in a smoky glaze of hickory barbecue sauce and honey mustard, buffalo-style wings in a piquant dry rub served with the customary blue cheese and celery, and the franchise's famous fajitas filled with your choice of grilled meat, tangy pico de gallo, and melty cheese. For something heftier, there's also grilled steaks and a selection of meats from the smokehouse, think massive pork ribs and beef brisket in a tangy, hickory-spiked barbecue sauce. Good food, good times, and good music have always been part of the Hard Rock promise, and at this grand old dame of the late-night Orchard scene, the party never stops.

Basically, you order a crab done in one of their six styles, and have them with some carbs. The carbs are amazing though: think heavenly, lard-and-seafood kissed, wok-breath infused Hokkien Mee, a fine Bee Hoon steeped in a rich clam broth, or the HolyCrab Fried Rice stirred up with flecks of crab meat. But all this is only accessory to the real deal: massive crabs cooked in rich sauces. The signature item is the Holy Crab, an angelic vision featuring a Crab cooked in a rich crab broth, with lots of vermicelli to soak up the goodness. Then there’s the Orgasmic Crab, with a little sin injected by way of a salted egg & curry leaf gravy that is the perfect foil for sweet bouncy crabmeat. For something with more unusual twist, there’s the Balsamic Crab, with the meaty crustaceans bathed in a pungent, sweet, and acidic sauce made with balsamic vinegar, fresh herbs, and spices. Then there’s the house version of Singapore’s national dish: Singapore Chili Crab, and there are five levels of spiciness you can choose from, one for each decade of our independence.

Recipients of \"Singapore's Favourite Food\" in 2013, and also voted the \"Best Pepper Crab in Singapore\", it's clear that diners love the restaurant's ability to serve that perfect pincer.\nOne taste of their famous signature Black Pepper Crab and you'll be in love too! Their use of a milder pepper gives just enough heat to allow the sweetness of the ocean-fresh Sri Lankan crab to really come through, and often means you'll be down two claws before you've even realised how much you've eaten!\nThese capable culinary captains of crustaceans are capable of more than just that though. At Home of Seafood, you have the option of having your crab steamed, buttered, chilled, cocktail-ed, claypot-ted, or spiced up with chilli. Our personal favourite of the lot? The Salted Egg Crab. Salty, sweet, savoury, and velvety smooth, their version of this increasingly popular dish has us wondering if the days of Chili Crab as the ambassador of Singaporean cuisine might indeed be limited.\nSo whether you vote chili, pepper, or salted egg, rest assured that you've got a home away from home nestled in the increasingly hip neighbourhood of Joo Chiat.

This restaurant does exactly what it says on the cover: using an ancient, stone-age cooking method, your food arrives raw on the table before gradually cooking on sizzling-hot serpentinite stones from the European Alps that store heat well and, apart from giving your food to a perfect, juicy sear, keeps them warm throughout the meal.\nWith a great view of the river outside, especially from the lofty second floor dining area, part of the charm is a friendly crowd, made up of families and customers who’ve been coming here since 1992. Can you blame them? The premium meats here are cooked to smoky, piping-hot perfection. Choose from beautifully marbled Kurobuta pork or high-grade Tajima Wagyu, both of which sing on the hot stones and soften to sweet, tender, melt-in-your-mouth chunks.

Whether it’s the baked goods at the counter, a fragrant Mariage Frères tea, or punchy Allpress Coffee, this is the hottest spot for a premium afternoon. There’s also heartier bites like open-faced sandwiches topped with farm-fresh produce: beautiful eggs, vegetables, and meats elegantly arrayed on artisanal bread and drizzled with light dressing. Tuck into Maria’s Moussaka, a cheesy, eggplant-based Belgian “lasagna” filled with minced beef and a light bechamel sauce, or the house Carbonnades, a ragout of beef cheek, yellow spud potatoes, tender baby carrots, and a malty Trappiste beer sauce.

From its vibrant atmosphere and the beautiful bridges, to the Dutch’s bicycle-oriented lifestyle, he knew that there wouldn’t be anything quite like Amsterdam. Upon returning to sunny Singapore, his love affair led him to start a cafe in 2013 that would be all things Dutch.\n\nNow, the I am… Cafe is serves up amazing cafe grub to a bustling crowd everyday. And in case you were wondering, yes, the name is inspired by Amsterdam’s iconic ‘I amsterdam’ sign. Must-trys include the Dutch-inspired Fries & Mayo, featuring crispy thick-cut fries with a generous helping of rich mayonnaise. If you’re here with a group of friends, go for the I am... Platter, an elaborate showcase of all their starters such as the half-shell mussels, soft-shell crabs, buffalo wings, and many more. The perfectly battered Fish ‘N’ Chips has also garnered considerable fame, so be sure to try it while you’re here. You probably would have seen photos of their homemade cakes on your instagram feed, such as the cafe’s popular Rainbow Cake that’s as delicious as it is insta-worthy.

The kanji or Chinese letters are extremely apt, literally translating it to \"one breath\". And at IKKI, lunch is like a battlefield, with the kitchen dishing out lunch set after lunch set, the staff seemingly holding their breath until the whole ordeal is over.\nTransitioning to the lull afternoon, IKKI brings their own blend of artisanal coffee with waffles, Japanese style. Known as Mochi Mochi waffles or Mmoffles for short, these Japanese waffles are crispy on the outside and extremely chewy on the inside. The waffles can be paired with salty sweet mitarashi and red bean, or customers can opt for the savoury ham and cheese version.\nNight at IKKI is a different affair altogether. The whole place slows down and the menu changes from lunch sets to Yakitori or barbecued skewers, and a plethora of Japanese tapas that allow customers to eat and drink at their leisure. And to keep the festivities going, IKKI features local bands playing from Tuesday to Friday.

Priding itself on authentic fare, a smoky oven churns out pizzas to order, and these pies have attracted quite a following among in-the-know foodies in the neighbourhood. Choose from a comprehensive menu of practically every pizza flavour known to Man, from a piquant Puglia pie topped with anchovies, kalamata olives, artichokes, and mushrooms to the ubiquitous and controversial Hawaiian. If you’re a purist, stick to classic flavours like Cipolla e Pancetta, a red-sauce pie scattered with crispy pancetta, onions, and melty cheese. \n\nThere’s also pasta dishes that will help fix any Italian craving. Think well-made authentic pasta plates here, none of that watered-down business you tend to find in Italian joints around the city. The Bucatini All’Amatriciana is a heavenly plate of tubular spaghetti tossed in a spicy, porky sauce of tomatoes, cured Guanciale (pork cheek), and tangy pecorino cheese. The Carbonara is a close cousin, made with a cheese and egg sauce instead of tomato, and prepared exactly as it is in Rome, with lashings of spicy rendered lard, black pepper, and no cream whatsoever. Grilled steaks and fish round out the menu, though honestly we think the hefty pizza and pasta plates will keep even the greediest of diners happy.

In an interior done up to look like a warm dining room - parquet floors, Peranakan antiques, and cosy lighting - orders are brought to your table with little fanfare, confident in their authentic flavours and contemporary touches.\nFundamental Nyonya techniques, classic recipes, and fresh spices, pounded together using the tried-and-true pestle and mortar method, result in fragrant traditional offerings like Kueh Pie Tee (crisp pastry cups filled with shredded turnip, served with prawns, crabmeat, and homemade chili dip), Ngoh Hiang (homemade five-spiced pork meat roll wrapped in soy bean curd skin and deep fried), and Organic Ayam Buah Keluak (braised organic chicken with black nut and exotic spices).\nThat's not to say that Indocafe is stuck in the past though; little tweaks to suit modern tastes are a constant feature in their menu. Feast on dishes such as the Otah Klasik (steamed 'Chawanmushi' egg custard with fish fillet, seasoned with coconut milk, and a special blend of herb and spices) and Chendol Panna Cotta, both great examples of when past and present collide.\nOnce you're done tasting a slice of Singapore's heritage, don’t forget to trot over to their Arts & Cultural Central where a little coffee appreciation and afternoon performance might go a long way!

Deceptively simple, the potent flavour of the dish comes from achieving the perfect balance between the saltiness of the fish against the crunchiness of the vegetables, as well as the softness of the hor fun noodles. Having been around for more than 40 years, and with an extensive array of traditional zi char dishes, plus its Signature Fish Noodle Soup, it is easy to see why Ka-Soh occupies a special place in every Singaporean foodie’s heart.

While the menu does serve a range of more modern items, the majority of the dishes feature traditional Cantonese flavours without introducing too many fancy tweaks. In fact, any change that executive chef and owner, Fung Chi Keung, makes is carefully chosen to enhance your dining experience.\nDishes manage to achieve full flavours without compromising the delicate tastes of ingredients, and presentations don't lack for fun or interest. The Garoupa in Lobster Soup will have your server bringing forth a whole garoupa - freshly sliced - to be cooked in an intensely orange lobster soup right at your table. The resulting broth is deep and chock full of tender fish. Their Peking Duck is a signature, understandably so given the deliciously crispy skin, and will be sliced and prepared at the table to be served with a selection of innovative wraps and sauces. Not to worry, their less exorbitant items are equally as amazing. Try their surprisingly succulent Sweet & Sour Pork on the Rocks which are served like colourful lollipops on a bed of ice.\nWith over 15 years and a previous position with Paradise Group, Chef Fung's expertise reaches from dim sum to excellent roasts, and Kai Garden is the perfect place to sample his creations.

Derived from the word \"cosmos\" - a system of thought, Kausmo is the brainchild of co-founders Lisa Tang and Kuah Chew Shian.\nThe design of the 16-seater restaurant revolves around the concept of a \"blank canvas\", setting the stage for the transformation of aesthetically imperfect ingredients into delicious dishes. Every dish created at Kausmo incorporates thoughtfully sourced ingredients; seafood from small farming communities in the region, secondary cuts of meat which are often overlooked in favour of prime cuts, as well as forgotten native greens and florals. Combining European techniques with Asian influences, Lisa, who has worked at Pollen, Jaan, and Les Amis, demonstrates how lesser-loved ingredients are no less delicious than their popular counterparts.\nExpect to be greeted with a sense of comfort too as parts of the menu draws inspiration from the team's cultural roots, such as Lisa's Teochew heritage. Each meal at Kausmo presents a thoughtful approach for guests to think about how they can all make more conscientious choices in their everyday lives and contribute to a more sustainable ecosystem, in Singapore and beyond. The restaurant even has a dedicated retail and feature space that showcases works by local businesses, artists and craftsmen with thoughtfulness as their focus.\nUltimately, Kausmo offers good food with a good cause, creating an authentic and warm space for conversations about thoughtful choices and conscientious living to happen around the dining table.

Situated atop the Customs House building with knockout views of MBS, it's no surprise to learn that Kinki has some celebrity backing. However, given the edgy, underground vibe of the place, it makes sense that the celebrity in question is a fictional sumo wrestler, who defies all odds to allow his culinary alter ego to shine. His story is etched all over the restaurant and bar, from the wild floor mural by an artist of \"Miami Ink\" TV fame, to the graffiti clad walls and comic book styled menu.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDespite the laidback persona of the place - with sneaker-wearing waitstaff and up-to-the-moment beats always pumping - the cuisine at Kinki Restaurant is nonetheless inventive, high-end and would make the restaurant's namesake proud. A palatable selection of mains includes the High Roller Wagyu Don - features ohmi A4 wagyu, Hokkaido uni, ikura, summer black truffle, onsen egg, Premium Unagi Claypot with homemade umami sauce and more. There's also traditional sushi and sashimi handled by masterful chefs behind the ice bar. \"Rock & Roll\" offers an interesting mix of creative maki rolls that lesser sushi restaurants are too risk-averse to try.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf there ever were a sushi bar bold enough to go for it, while still paying respects to the artistry of the cuisine, Kinki would be it. The Foie Gras and Scallop Nigiri features delicate, pan seared foie with a plump, juicy Hokkaido-bred scallop, while the Golden Age offers an expert balance of meaty fish and bright fruit. There are more filling mains and cleverly crafted cold dishes as well, a selection that is well suited for any range of hunger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOn the alfresco front, level three rooftop bar is a frequent hangout for the after-work crowd, with a plentiful selection of sake as well as the envelope-pushing cocktails you would expect from such a thrilling spot as Kinki. Long-standing favourites are the Kinki Mango Mint and Gin Berry. Their food menu also features an array of small bites such as Karaage Chicken Bao and Squid and chips.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNow a well-established mainstay along the Marina Bay waterfront, rest assured there are no kinks to be worked out in Kinki Restaurant's daring and delicious concept.

And her efforts have paid off, as seen by the teeming crowds who pack the Tanjong Pagar restaurant till the wee hours of the morning. Choose from four different flavours of fried chicken: original, soy garlic sauce, sweet & spicy, as well as hot & spicy. Can’t decide? Then the Combo Chicken Set is probably your best bet. \n \nAnd fried chicken isn’t the only thing up for grabs here, with accompanying sides and mains that are worth their weight in gold. Dining in a group? Then go for the Bu Dae Jji Gae, better known as the Army Stew. This bubbling pot of vegetable stew comes bursting with noodles, spam, and mushrooms, and is more than enough to fill the tummies of several ravenous diners. \n \nWhether you’re looking for an after-work hangout for some top-notch Korean grub, KKO KKO NARA is sure to meet those expectations and more.

The result is a sleek and starkly minimalistic cafe that’s the perfect venue for a mid-day hangout session where you can sip on a cup of coffee while soaking in the sunlight pouring in from their ceiling-to-floor windows. Aside from the coffees, this bistro also pumps out a fair number of cafe bites that are equal parts hearty and equal parts pleasing.

The decor beyond its entrance is redolent of Paris – more specifically the relaxed bistro culture that’s so common to the French city – as diners sit shoulder to shoulder in a long, cosy stretch whilst wine and conversation flow freely.\nThe Plat du Jour is always their classic Steak Frites, slivers of succulent prime meat generously doused with a secret sauce that pairs perfectly with each melt-in-your-mouth bite. Accompanying those piping hot babies are a fresh green salad and a heaping pile of crispy, golden fries. Finished your first round and hungry for more?

Head here with friends after work for some tipples to welcome the weekend at the bar, or romance a date in the elegant ambience of the restaurant - whatever the occasion, this spot has got you covered.\nWith esteemed chef Takashi Okuno helming the kitchen, diners can expect a riot of flavours from the dishes here. Fresh ingredients, innovative cooking techniques, and an unorthodox take on classic Italian cuisine make for a menu bursting with dishes you wouldn’t find at a typical Trattoria. When in doubt, you can’t go wrong with something that is housemade.Start with the Housemade Wagyu Bresaola- an air-dried cured beef bursting with flavour. The meat has more intense flavours due to the dry ageing process, and as a result, this dish is perfect paired with a glass of red wine from the bar. For something a little moreish, opt for the Gnocchi Formaggi - a four-cheese pasta dish topped with creamy sauce. End off a meal here with the Luka Tiramisu - a coffee flavoured dessert that will leave your taste buds tingling.

Anne-Sophie Pic hails from a long lineage of chefs with the Pic family's culinary heritage beginning since their first restaurant started in 1889. As a third-generation Michelin-starred chef, Anne-Sophie Pic follows in the footsteps of her father and grandfather, perfectly reflecting Raffles Singapore's rich heritage that has inspired generations since the iconic property was established in 1887. Indulge in exquisite signature creations such as the Berlingots – iconic pasta parcels found in all of Anne-Sophie Pic's restaurants around the world with unique and slight adaptations to reflect the character of each establishment's locale. At La Dame de Pic, Raffles Singapore the incarnation of the signature Berlingots incorporates an Asian touch with a new flavour association using Red Kampot pepper, which enhances the Berlingots' French cheese fondue filling. Other specialties include Saga Wagyu Beef, roasted Japanese wagyu accompanied with smoked beetroot and a osmanthus-infused mushroom broth; and Blue Lobster slow-roasted with shellfish butter and served with a coriander-and-barley-infused broth. \r\nThe culinary magic continues with desserts such as Anne-Sophie Pic's signature White Mille-feuille, featuring ginger flower light cream, confit grapefruit and Litsea cubeba emulsion; and Araguani Chocolate, which contrasts light Araguani chocolate mousse, Nikka whisky caramel and smoked Tahitian vanilla ice cream for a decadent finish to the dining experience. \r\nGuests can look forward to beverage pairing options available on request, with an in-house sommelier on the floor to offer recommendations catered to guests' personal preferences. Guests are welcome to bring one bottle of wine of their own and enjoy complimentary corkage when they purchase a bottle of wine. Our sommeliers will also be on hand to enhance your dining experience with a curated wine list that reflects Anne-Sophie's culinary vision.

With knowledgeable bartenders, cocktail gurus, and suppliers constantly on hand to answer your questions or turn you on to their new favourite tipple, this is a veritable temple of booze where you always come away feeling a little more knowledgeable about your tasty poisons.\nIf you’re looking to be schooled on classic cocktails, look no further. You can order a bracing Sazerac, a classic Old Fashioned, a refined Manhattan, or a frosty Mint Julep, and those are just the whisky cocktails. And if you like what you taste, your bartender can point you to the right spirit so you can take on home to rinse and repeat as much as you like. If you prefer your whisky by the dram (or bottle), simply ask for a recommendation and the bar team will help you out with their cavernous whisky selection, and possibly even arrange for a tasting flight. They’re here to help you have a good time, so just ask away. It’s a small bar, so book your space today!

End your meal on a sweet note with Lawry’s Signature dessert- the Strawberry English Trifle.","PRESS RELEASE":"","images":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455621_27268.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455621_47393.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455622_88914.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455623_61083.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455623_72845.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455624_40401.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455624_37796.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455625_74462.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/11/s-725x360x80xo_1606455626_29868.jpg?date=202106080907"]},{"title":"Lazat","Cuisine":"Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Vietnamese, Local, Southeast Asian, Modern Asian, BBQ","Menus":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/1618896775_63428.pdf"],"Hours":"Mon-Sun: 8:30am-10:30pm","Price":"$$","Good For":"Al Fresco, Business Meetings, Casual Dining, Kid Friendly, Private Functions, Quiet Dinner, Romantic Dates","Location":"Bukit Batok","Address":"2 Bukit Batok West Ave 7 #01-09C Singapore (659003)                                                Map","Address Link":"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1.3656942,103.7490389&query_place_id=ChIJzWHmtxgR2jERcK0kK4ETh8w","DISHES WE LOVE":"Nasi Lemak, Belachan Drumlets, Signature Truffle Fried Rice, Salted Egg Prawn","ABOUT":"Get more bang for your buck at Lazat!

Enjoy the Milk-Battered Calamari that is topped with copious amount of chicken floss and tangy lemon tartar sauce. For mains, the Fishermen’s Angel Hair is a great fusion noodle dish with a spicy sambal kick. If seafood is not your thing, fear not! Soaked in a special marinate for 24 hours, the Honey Charred Chicken emerges completely tender and succulent, definitely a crowd favourite for a reason. For a sweet finish, try Mary’s Butter Cake, which is a buttery vanilla cake topped with either chocolate or vanilla ice cream, cookie crumbles, and berries.\nThe team at Lighthouse Bistro is extremely dedicated and driven to create good memories for you.

Having had extensive experience working at some of the most luxurious resorts in the Caribbean, he means serious business when it comes to churning out delicious fare.\n \nKirk puts his spin on classics but isn't afraid to introduce new and exciting dishes that evoke the Caribbean. Pepper Shrimp, Seafood Cakes, Calypso Fish, Blue Mountain Steak, Fire Roasted Stuffed Sweet Potato, and Tropics Cheesecake, it's an endless list of punchy flavours. With a “welcome home” philosophy at the core of the Lime House Caribbean Experience, diners are also free to make themselves comfortable by sharing hearty platters of Wings, Sliders, and an assortment of other trademark Caribbean bites that are sure to become favourites.\n \nRenowned philosopher Captain Jack Sparrow once posed the existential question, \"But why is the rum gone\"?

Founded in the early 2000s in Inner Mongolia, this greenhorn shook up the hotpot scene in China with their innovative hotpot -- minus the dipping sauce. Their rich broth all but made up for the lack of condiments, and the recipe has stayed consistent for over eighteen years. What’s so special about the broth? The savoury soup base, made with seven special spices and mutton from Inner Mongolia, retains its signature flavour even after long hours of boiling. \r\n\r\nThe Four Mushroom Soup is one of their most popular broths. Earthy and not too spicy, this base choice adds richness to all the items added. Meat-lovers are sure to enjoy the array of dishes on offer for the hotpot. The Australia Sirloin Beef Cubes are rich and buttery, and absorb the spices of the soup, enhancing the meat’s flavour with a spicy kick.

Founded in the early 2000s in Inner Mongolia, this greenhorn shook up the hotpot scene in China with their innovative hotpot -- minus the dipping sauce. Their rich broth all but made up for the lack of condiments, and the recipe has stayed consistent for over eighteen years. What’s so special about the broth? The savoury soup base, made with seven special spices and mutton from Inner Mongolia, retains its signature flavour even after long hours of boiling. \r\n\r\nThe Four Mushroom Soup is one of their most popular broths. Earthy and not too spicy, this base choice adds richness to all the items added. Meat-lovers are sure to enjoy the array of dishes on offer for the hotpot. The Australia Sirloin Beef Cubes are rich and buttery, and absorb the spices of the soup, enhancing the meat’s flavour with a spicy kick.

Those who prefer a dessert in a glass should go for the Almond Mimosa, an ambrosial potion of prosecco blended with toasted almonds and marzipan.\r\n\r\nBesides tipples, Live Twice excels in the food department too, offering a selection of elevated izakaya food. Light bites include the Wasabi Cheese Terrine, where fresh wasabi is grated on cubes of cream cheese, while heartier appetites will be satisfied by a range of sandwiches such as the Beef Katsu Sando.

However, Lolla has proven itself to be the cream of the crop, as evidenced by the standard wait list for a reservation to sample their fare. Here's some insider intel: book for lunch, where you can request a seat at the coveted bar (which is saved for those few well-timed walk-ins come dusk) and avoid the feeding frenzy of dinner time service. Why is the zinc-plated bar the place to be? From here, you can watch the compact kitchen create the wondrous small plates that have earned Lolla international acclaim.\nSuch plates include the Sea Urchin Pudding, a deceivingly miniature vessel of deadly-rich egg yolk custard, blackened by squid ink and topped with tangerine-coloured morsels of urchin plucked straight from the ocean. The dish is at once thick and light, the depths of umami refreshed by a spritz of the sea. The Beef Tongue Escalopes are similarly brilliant, tenderized to banish any minerally gristle and which presents a unique meaty flavour spiked by pickled sides. The Scrambled Eggs with Bottarga is a high-end play on the smoked salmon breakfast staple, the feathery eggs punctuated by shavings of fish roe. All dishes benefit from a glass of bubbly, which is intentionally the bar's specialty. It's a fitting choice since the extraordinary dining experience at Lolla isn't exactly a steal, making it ideal for special occasions.\nIn the basement, a large, democratic table-for-all accommodates the majority of diners, a design choice that loosens up the mood. The concrete and bare bulb ascetic is softened by vintage touches like antique crystal vases posted alongside family-sized cans of artisan ingredients atop the bar. The menus are simply stated and printed with Victorian comics on paper placemats. The décor, along with the exceptional culinary musings served, ensure that Lolla really lives up to the hype.

Named in a playful reference to the idiosyncrasies of local speech and culture, ‘loof’ is a play on the way Singaporeans pronounce ‘roof’. Awarded as Singapore's best rooftop bar, Loof serves up quality whimsy, fresh nostalgia and unbridled playfulness in an urban garden atop Odeon Towers in downtown CBD.\r\n\r\nEnjoy carefully crafted Southeast Asian inspired cocktails that are familiar yet unique. Cocktails in the limelight include Firecracker, a gin-based concoction that playfully pairs the flavours of watermelon and chilli with just the right amount of spice to pack a punch. Another must-try is Rum, Forrest, Rum, a refreshing blend of dark rum, pandan-infused Amaro Montenegro and pineapple husk-infused syrup. The Set B is a buzzy spin on the Singaporean breakfast staple of traditional kopi and kaya toast with vodka, Mr. Black coffee liqueur, kaya and espresso.\r\n\r\nIn nostalgic tribute to Loof’s earlier years, signatures such as the Loof Bubble Tea and the cheeky Uncle Tee-Kee continue as mainstays on the menu. For guests seeking other speciality libations, Loof also offers a wide variety of Asian spirits, from Japanese whiskies and sake to local craft beers Sunday’s Brew and Lion Brewery.\r\n\r\nThe cuisine, aptly coined ‘Dude-Sin’ (Dude-Singaporean), is a modern Singaporean riff on typical bar grub done in a style that is anything but ‘atas’. Divided into four categories: chip chip, sticks and balls, and buns, the menu features bar snacks full of local flavour from every Singaporean’s favourite Chilli Crab Dip to our bold take on the notorious Ramly Burger.\r\n\r\nAfter all this time, Loof continues to offer the best view of the Raffles Hotel and her surrounding area and remains one of the hippest and funkiest places to meet old friends and make new ones. There’s a palpable energy that permeates the bar, and sitting there, amidst the skyscrapers, urban gardens, and buzzing crowd of locals, expatriates and tourists, you can’t help but be swept up in that pulse of the city night.

Behind the bar, the diligent Chef Derrick Lau chats up some guests at the bar while delivering plate after plate of sushi made from the freshest catch of the day. There’s not much of a menu here, just a few tiers of set meals, filled up by whatever the chef decides is best to serve that day. Omakase is the word, and you leave your meal in the capable hands of the chef and his direct-from-Japan supply chain.\nDepending on the season, feast on tender slices of monk fish liver, creamy cod milt, fatty tuna belly, and year-round favourites like sea bream, salmon, yellow tail, and horse mackerel. Chef Lau, a huge favourite among Japanese cuisine connoisseurs in Singapore, is well-known for his innovative and sophisticated omakase menus, so whenever you drop by, you’re in for a treat. If you’re not looking for a special-occasion omakase meal, there are bento-style set dinners here too, like pan fried beef, seasonal sashimi and tempura on rice, Wagyu steak, and a bountiful Bara Chirashi, a bowl of rice topped with chopped sashimi.

This is reflected in the menu, which focuses on premium ingredients cooked to bring out their best flavours. \r\n\r\nThe Wok-Fried Crispy Duck is a must-try. Made with tender duck meat fried to perfection, this dish is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and goes perfectly with a bowl of steamed rice. Another signature plate at this restaurant would be The White Pepper Crab, a less searing version of one of Singapore’s most iconic fare. This seafood delight preserves the airy egg white sauce but uses white pepper for a more delicate flavour. \r\n\r\nDiners who love their carbs can indulge in the Claypot Japanese Rice With Japanese Sweet Potato. The claypot cooking enhances the taste of the dish and its accompanying items, giving the rice a heartier taste, while the Japanese sweet potato provides some delicate sweetness, balancing out the flavours. The Lobster Cantonese with Wanton Noodle is another great option as the lobster meat is lightly sweet and juicy, and pairs perfectly with the tender noodles.

Their outdoor tables have a casual elegance that look (and feel) incredibly comfortable, and during the drier months of Singapore's skies, are an excellent place to have a long, wine-enriched dinner with friends.\nOn the new menu, the Appetizers section is headlined with Michelangelo's famed Calamari Fritti. The light crunchy morsels come with two dipping sauces, and it's no wonder they come highly recommended by regulars and staff alike. The menu now offers two pasta sections: Pasta Classico which offers a range of Singapore’s favourite pasta selections, and Pasta Speciali where all your Michelangelo's signatures return to delight you once more. There are, of course, non-pasta options like the Seafood Cartoccio, which is a sublime medley of seafood cooked in a white wine and tomato broth wrapped in a paper package.\nIt's a varied and delicious sounding menu, and since we’re sure that Michelangelo's will still be winning fans for many years to come, you’ve got all the time you need to try every single option that tickles your fancy.

The more classic fare on the plats principaux, from Argentinian Beef Tenderloin given the simple salt and jus treatment, to an elegant risotto of asparagus and seared Boston lobster, sweet, buttery, and indulgent.

But while Majestic Bay Seafood does a wonderful rendition of both, what you should really be there for is Chef Yong Bing Ngen's award-winning, signature creation: the Kopi Crab. This dish is a reflection of Chef Yong's culinary philosophy that Chinese cooking is a great canvas for bold, artistic flourishes. Tossed with a sauce made from fruit jams and juices, and three varieties of coffee beans, the crab's flavours blend harmoniously, leaving you savouring every last morsel! Flambéed tableside, it's one of those dishes that you never knew was missing from your foodie bucket list until you've tried it.\r\nIf you're fishing around Gardens by the Bay for a light bite, Majestic Bay Seafood also fits the bill. Its tantalising dim sum, only available for lunch, is worth a visit on its own. Pick from local favourites like Steamed Custard Buns with Salted Egg Yolk, oozing with creamy goodness, or signatures like their Seared Chilli Crab Meat Buns.\r\nDining at Majestic Bay Seafood is as much a feast for the eyes as it is for our bellies. Indeed, if it weren't for the restaurant's impressive waterfront view of Marina Bay, and magnificent display of 3D textured artworks by Singapore-based artist Hong Zhu An, we'd be sorely tempted to pack a basket of that dim sum for a picnic among the lush greenery!

The combination of  fragrant rice and spicy meat is a good option for diners looking for a filling meal. For something a little less rich, opt for the Garlic Naan, a herby flatbread that is perfect on its own, or dipped in a curry.

Paired with the earthy richness of the sauce, it’s sure to leave you wanting for more. \r\n\r\nNoodle enthusiasts are sure to love the unique Champon ramen. A traditional version of the Singaporean Hokkien Mee, this recipe is made with a broth of chicken and pork bones, stringy noodles, and topped with chunks of lard, seafood, and vegetables. The result is a flavourful meal that is best enjoyed on a cold day with some beer. \r\n\r\nSpeaking of beer, barflies will be glad to know that there are various happy hour promotions at Mikoto, cementing its place as one of the CBD’s favourite watering holes.

Under the deft hands of Fukuoka-native Chef Mitsuyasu Tatsuro, simple sushi ingredients are made to shine. The chef employs a “one fish, three ways” approach to his food, so diners can choose one fish from the daily menu and have it cooked three different ways. One notable standout is the Alaskan King Crab, cooked in styles that run the gamut from kaminabe, tempura, and sashimi to grilled & served with vinegar, simmered, or in chawanmushi. Other must-try menu items include the Soft-shell Crab Roll paired with a mildly spicy mayo. The Asari Clam Soup is another divine dish that doubles up as a refreshing palate cleanser. Then complement the fresh seafood offerings with any of the eatery’s numerous sake and shochu options, such as the Nama Sake, an unfiltered and unpasteurised sake that goes down smoothly with sushi.\n\nThere’s nothing quite like an omakase meal, a chef-curated meal where all you have to do is sit back and enjoy the journey. And if there’s any restaurant that ranks among the best, it’s Mitsu Sushi Bar.

Tuck into three kinds of appetisers, and a refreshing salmon carpaccio. Dinner then progresses to an assortment of seasonal sashimi, served on a bed of ice and beautifully garnished with edible flowers. A bowl of piping hot clear soup is a good palate-cleanser, before the chef serves up the main courses — nigiri sushi, a mini don bowl, and miso soup, ending with some sweet Japanese fruit and hot tea for dessert. Sushi fans can opt for a full Nigiri Sushi Omakase, which comes with 15 pieces of nigiri sushi and a handroll. \r\n\r\nHead chef Kenny is also an expert in pairing whisky with Japanese food, so be sure to ask him for recommendations on a delicious dram for an accompanying nightcap.

From the gilded mahjong gold tiles on the tables to the cushy upholstery arranged with purposeful carelessness, everything about this bar screams ostentatious excess.\r\n\r\nThe draw here are the cocktails, each with their unique link to Mona, the elusive third wife the restaurant draws its name from. Ask, and the bartenders are sure to regale you with tales of Mona’s exploits, and how each concoction got its name. Sip on the light Lady’s Elixir, a mix of Remy Martin and VSOP mixed with monk fruit soda and sea salt drops for a lightly sweet flavour. Purported to have “close to zero” calories, this is the perfect drink for diners watching their waistlines. \r\n\r\nFor something closer to home, try the Songstress.

As you walk along this iconic river, you can't help but sense an instant lightness in your step, a bounce in your walk, and a rumble in your belly. And if you think there's something reminiscent of the canals of Venice, why not answer that rumble with a trip to Mondo Mio?\nMondo Mio is an authentic Southern Italian restaurant which is as Italian as it gets. Freshly-made pizza and pasta make up the bulk of the menu and cheese is used generously. Still not enough cheese? The Four Cheese Pizza comes highly recommended. Fans of the thin thin-crust variety of the famous Italian pie will also enjoy the satisfying biscuit-like crunch with each bite.\nIf you're not a huge fan of either pizza or pasta, or just happen to be craving for a good chunk of meat, the premium veal shank is your answer. Braised on low fire with rosemary and thyme, the shank comes served on a bed of rich and flavourful saffron risotto made with simmered Italian Arborio rice. Just the sight of it is guaranteed to make you want to belt out a melody like a Gondola singer.

Unafraid to colour outside the lines of traditional small plates cuisine, the menu is constantly evolving; filled with diverse, smoky fare, prepared from an open kitchen that features an INKA charcoal grill.\nThe surrounding bar helps revive the \"counter culture\", acting as the best seats in the house amongst a refreshingly non-traditional approach to décor. Dusky wood tones and mismatched chairs channel a cool cabin in the woods, while inked up walls and an indie soundtrack provide an energetic rhythm to the place.\nStandouts on the menu include sweet-savoury bacon wrapped chargrilled dates with roast garlic aioli and crunchy pine nuts, fried artichoke, house-made ricotta and bottarga shavings, and the cauliflower, garlic miso and leek confit. A favourite of other local chefs, which is perhaps the greatest endorsement of all, Moosehead is one to watch on the Singapore dining scene - that is, if you're not already hooked.

The interior of this restaurant is almost as green as its exterior, with hanging plants, repurposed wooden furniture, and wood panelling reminiscent of a weatherboard cottage.\n\nThis restaurant has won many accolades throughout the years and has gained an experience for their excellent food, and it’s not difficult to see why. Chef-Owner Petrina Loh draws on her childhood for inspiration for her dishes, and has created sharing platters of fusion cuisine that feature the perfect balance of flavours. \n\nDiners looking for a unique dish can try the Pork Jowl Char Siew Wonton Mee. Made with tender, locally sourced pork jowl, herbal soy sauce, pork and kimchi wontons, and a fiery jalapeño chilli sauce, this dish seamlessly incorporates the spice of Korean and Latin American cuisine into a dish that is uniquely Singaporean. \n\nLooking for a unique treat to end your meal? Look no further than the Jackfruit Banana Cake. Made with chunks of fragrant jackfruit and sweet banana, and topped with Mugi miso meringue and drizzled with chocolate sauce, this dish is deliciously sweet without being cloying, and the perfect dessert to end an excellent meal. \n\nUltimately, while Chef Petrina's culinary pedigree is nothing to sniff at, with Le Cordon Bleu and a stint at HUSK in Nashville under her belt, it's really the intimate hospitality and innovative courses that will keep you coming back, time and time again, for more.

Chef Edward Esmero joins Chef Maria Sevillano in the kitchen and promises to bring a completely new perspective to the cuisine that has so quickly settled as one of our island's favourites.\nThere is still a strong focus on authentic, home-cooked style dishes, and the new revamped menu combines old favourites with new ones. Simple, classic favourites like the Pulpo de la Casa (grilled fresh octopus seasoned with pimenton, sea salt, and olive oil) or the Chuletillas de Cordero ($32), pan-fried cutlets of milk-fed lamb with a garlic white wine reduction, are exactly reminiscent of the local fare in the countryside regions of Spain. The team is also introducing a brunch menu that's only available on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays (till 3pm) that include a Spanish version of the classic ham and eggs! Considering the general quality of Spanish ham, that sounds amazing to us!\n Chef Edward shares that My Little Spanish Place aims to be somewhere friends and family can bond over a good meal, so round up those friends and family members! Any excuse for a good meal works for us!

With simple, classic fare done as the Spanish do - as an accompaniment to long, lovely evenings filled with wine and laughter - My Little Tapas bar is sure to steal your heart.\nTaking a more authentic approach to tapas than usual, per its sister restaurant My Little Spanish Place, this tapas bar is all about the bona fide, Iberian originals - an all-Spanish wine list, five types of jamones carved-to-order, Spanish cheeses and only the most fundamental of Spanish snacks. The interior features rough-hewn woody tones and modern touches like bare bulbs. Spanish flare is evident in vintage posters, bullfighter-red napkins and rope accents that recall a traditional torero. The wine list is concise and convincing, each entry boasting its high Robert Parker and (Spanish equivalent) GUIA Penin scores, so you know that your choice will be a great one.\nThe cuisine is so classic and restrained that you can taste each ingredient that went into the dish. Andalusian flatbread features caramelized onions, piquillo peppers and a rioja reduction over grilled bread. The gambas are seasoned with smoky paprika and garlic, creating slurry so tasty that we recommend digging down into the dish long after the prawns are gone. For dessert, try the Chocolate Tart served with a traditional meringue sorbet with flavours of cinnamon. In all, My Little Tapas Bar's disarmingly chic combination of modern decor, warm vibe and delicious food has it poised to become your little tapas bar.

What remains is for you to enjoy the mystery of what’s on your plate, and discover a new element of taste: surprise. All the while, your blind guide helps you navigate the table and your plate, in a reversal of roles that will leave you with something to ponder beyond a delicious meal.\n\nThe food here is no afterthought, either, and features a French palette courtesy of veteran Chef, Desmond Lee. The meals change each day, but take the form of an appetizer, a main, and a dessert. In the dark, a meal may open with ethically-sourced foie gras paired with honey-sweet dried figs and a rich gorgonzola cream. A main course may take the form of a lobster tail, poached in butter and paired with a gelée of fennel, pickled radish, and chili-infused coconut broth, or meltingly tender Kobe beef short ribs served with thyme jam, compressed tomato, and creamy mash. Even in the dark, there’s room for dessert, especially sophisticated numbers like Manjari chocolate cremeux with a crumbly “soil” of cashew and chocolate, garnished with pink salt caramel and peanut sorbet. Strip yourself of one of your primary senses, and see what becomes intensified at this super cool dining experience!

Set up in 2009 by two old friends who were dissatisfied with the then-available options for Indian cuisine, Nalan Restaurant has blossomed into a gem that spins out authentic Indian vegetarian fare meticulously prepared with traditional cooking methods-- no doubt the reason for their impressive pool of loyal patrons who return for a heartwarming taste of home-cooked food.\nNalan’s dedication to their customers is clearly evident in their ability to cater to traditional Jain diets. Dishes without onion and garlic, such as Palak Paneer and Sbji Diwani-hundi, are commonplace and should you have any dietary restrictions or food allergies, Nalan’s skilled chefs are more than happy to whip something up for you without sacrificing taste or quality.\nThe menu also features an impressive range of options from all across India. We are major fans of the Paneer Butter Masala, featuring satisfying cottage cheese cubes drenched in a creamy sauce of tomato and butter. Tip: soak up every last drop of goodness with some naan. If you’re looking for some Western fare, Nalan’s got you covered too, with exciting options like the Asparagus and Baby Bella salad and the Rigatoni with Broccoli, Walnuts and Ricotta.

With its warm, friendly atmosphere and a menu that's easy to love, it's the perfect place for families and for those looking to unwind with friends at the bar after work.\nSink your teeth into an utterly decadent forkful of Rosemary Lamb with Truffle Potato Mash, and savour the balance of delicate rosemary fragrance and tender, grilled lamb chop. The truffle potato mash is an unforgettable component of the dish as well, and will linger (in all its truffle-scented glory) on your mind for days to come. You also can't miss out on the Chilli Crab Pasta, where large chunks of fresh crab meat are sautéed in the restaurant's irresistible homemade chilli crab sauce and served on top of a bed of spaghetti. If you're looking for a refreshing drink to wash all that down, then a Summer Sangria (which serves four) wouldn't be amiss - it's always summer in Singapore after all. The place also offers up a bevy of classic and other innovative cocktails, spirits, and other drinks to tickle your fancy if you feel so inclined.

Given that we've compared her to Julia Child previously, it's safe to say thatwe're fans.\nPeranakans didn't shy away from colour and were known for their intricate or opulent decorations, and you'll definitely see hints of this philosophy in National Kitchen. Decadent dark panels and mirrored walls are lit up by elegant wall sconces whilst references to the Peranakan way of life are peppered throughout the space. Rattan ceiling fans, distinctive tiles, and typical Singaporean foliage like palm leaves and orchids are just a few of the touches that make National Kitchen special.\nThe food is an excellent introduction into some of the more famous Peranakan dishes like Sambal Timun Nanas (pineapple and cucumber with chillies, onions and lightly sweet rice vinegar), Kiam Chye Ark Thng (soup of duck with salted mustard greens and a hint of spice chillies), and Buah Keluak Ayam (a stew of tangy chicken and the traditional buah keluak nuts). National Kitchen has also opened its menu's borders a little, offering other cultural favourites like Eurasian Beef Brisket Semor and Hakka Abacus Beads.\nBe warned though, while some of the dishes may be familiar and well-loved, the Peranakan options often prove to be divisive. Tuck in with an open mind though, and if you're looking for a sophisticated rendition of Peranakan food, you're in for a treat!

Niku Katsumata prides itself on serving some of the finest beef produced in Japan, plated in the simplest ways to highlight the natural flavours of the meat, and paired with various complementary dishes to create a full, beef-centric meal. At its barest level, the beef here is of such high quality that it’s served up as as sashimi. For cooked beef, one of the specialities here is Tataki Wagyu, a premium A4 Grade Wagyu that’s lightly seared before being placed atop a bowl of rice and given the ‘chasuke’ treatment: a light, savoury bonito stock is poured over the dish, which gently coaxes even more flavour from the beef. You have the option to top this up with premium, umami-rich ingredients like caviar, foie gras, or ikura. You can also have the beef in the form of a magnificent set meal, the A4 Wagyu Beef Set, which features Japanese Pork Prosciutto, a selection of home-made pickles, a premium selection of  A4 Wagyu Beef, and a Japanese A4 Beef Curry Rice. The beef here, beautifully marbled, tender, and served very rare, is prepared by chef Tsuyoshi Katsumata in the most unusual of ways: it’s cooked over a crystal plate, a method that apparently evenly distributes the heat and cooks the meat gently, ensuring it remains perfectly juicy. The incredible flavour of the beef at Niku Katsumata has to be tasted to be believed. A word of warning: you may never go back to your supermarket varieties after this!

A revolutionary collaboration between the Spa Espirit Group, Head Chef Oliver Truesdale Jutras, Souschef Phoebe Oviedo and award-winning food garden specialists, Edible Garden City, Open Farm Community is an urban farmland, horticultural hub, and restaurant all packed into one. At the heart of it all is one simple philosophy: to provide Singaporeans with a space to reconnect with nature whilst educating the young and old about local farming and the food we eat. The sprawling outdoor space features a garden brimming with herbs and vegetable produce, as well as educational breakout spaces alongside lawn bowling lanes and table tennis tables. True to their goal of educating city dwellers about the food we eat, tours of the vegetable and fruit orchards, talks, and gardening workshops are available too. The centrepiece is the gorgeous restaurant, a building with floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a high ceiling, the perfect place to unwind and tuck into some simple and honest fare.\n\nThe kitchen here adopts a strict no-no policy towards processed ingredients, imported produced, and unsustainable farming practices. This means that ingredients used here are mostly locally-sourced and always fresh - even the pasta is made fresh in-house! The menu is also one striking example of Open Farm Community’s dedication to serving honest food, with lengthy names laying out the different ingredients used in each dish. The flavours here are simple yet robust, focused around local farms and heritage, as epitomized by the Laksa Pappardelle, featuring soft shell prawn tempura, a spicy coconut based sauce and fresh laksa leaves from the garden; or the light and fresh watermelon salad, replete with lime and mint to balance the housemade ricotta from local Hay Dairies goat milk. A highlight was the Barramundi, straight from the waters off Pulau Ubin, combined with a sumptuous seaweed butter and organic dou miao, with puffed black rice crumbled over for a textural contrast.\n\nNow, whether you’re looking for romantic date spot, or a place where the kids can have some fun, Open Farm Community definitely provides an unforgettable experience for all.

While seasonings and sauces have their place, these two essentials go the longest way in ensuring a perfectly juicy, endlessly flavourful cut from pasture to plate. This is the philosophy of Opus Grill, the stunning new, mahogany clad steakhouse at Hilton Singapore. Featuring an impressive dining room with handsome furnishings, it has the feel of a solid modern grill experience long before you get a peek at the well-curated menu of grill basics.\n\nThe meat starts with 18 to 36 days of dry aging in a one-of-a-kind Himalayan salt tiled cabinet. The in-house curation makes a tasteful difference in the flavour and juiciness of the steak, and while there are a handful of choice cuts available, the dry-aged Rangers Valley Angus OP Rib with a Marble Score of 4 is a fast favourite. A sizeable beauty meant for two diners, the steak is carefully grilled upon an open-flame charcoal grill for an ideal flame-licked crust. Plus, you can choose from a selection of sauces and delectable side orders to go with the steak, though the grilled-to-perfection steak speaks for itself.\n\nFor less carnivorous diners, Opus is the first restaurant in the city to gain the MSC ecolabel for sustainable seafood, so you know the seafood come from the best possible place. Finish off with a charcoal grilled banana smoked with salted caramel and served with refreshing coconut and calamansi ice-cream - just the right kiss of sweetness to end your decadent evening.

You know it's serious stuff when the Caesar salad is tossed in a huge block of parmesan, ensuring that you get fresh chunks of nutty goodness. And if that's not enough, there's also a staggering selection of ingredients you can add to your salad, along with an assortment of seafood, soup and other cold starters.\nThe main courses are prepared fresh in small quantities each time (to ensure quality), right behind the counter in the library kitchen, where curious diners can observe all the action going on behind the scenes. The themes and menus change daily, so loyal patrons will always be kept on their toes. In fact, don't miss the noodle station that's located on the terrace. With a menu of local noodle dishes such as laksa and more, cooked-to-order, what's there not to love?\nDuring the weekends, Oscar's buffet ramps it up a notch with free-flow champagne, house wine, and beer to go along with their extensive selection of freshly shucked oysters, seafood on ice, and live carving stations.

For starters, begin the meal with some cheekily named Aussie-tizers. The Aussie Cheese Fries are a wicked indulgence, topped with melted Monterey Jack and cheddar, chopped crispy bacon, and spicy ranch dressing. Or try the unique Typhoon Bloom, where hand-cut fresh onion strings are generously dusted with Outback’s secret blend of seasoning and deep-fried until golden-brown. \r\n\r\nSteaks are the star of the show here, and the New York Strip is one of the restaurant’s best-sellers. The thick cut is first marinated in Outback’s secret spices, then seared over a sizzling hot grill to medium-rare perfection. The result is deeply flavourful meat that is tender and juicy at once. Looking to share the love? Order up the Porterhouse, a flavourful Strip and Fillet Tenderloin combined to give the best of both worlds. \r\n\r\nOutback also serves special cuts and combos for diners who want their steak with a side of shrimp, as well as a delectable Alice Springs Chicken. The flame-grilled chicken breast is the perfect choice for non-beef eaters, and comes loaded with mushrooms, bacon, and melted cheese.

PS.Cafe opened its second outlet at Harding Road in 2005 and the flagship outlet immediately stood out among its Dempsey Hill neighbours for its gorgeous space and stellar food. The cafe is set amidst lush greenery, a tropical oasis untouched by the concrete jungle that is Singapore. There’s an understated finesse about the space: sunlight floods the sprawling space through gorgeous glass-to-ceiling windows while minimalist furniture warms up the industrial-chic interior. \n\nTotally understandable if you’re tempted by the irresistible aroma of freshly baked pastries wafting through the air, but don’t forget about PS.Cafe’s brunch classics and signature cakes. With a Bellini or a Mimosa in hand, tuck into the PS. Fluffy Pancakes, the PS. Big Breakfast, or the irresistible PS. Brunch Burger, alongside the famed Truffle Shoestring Fries. Health junkies will especially enjoy the Superseed Granola and the protein-packed Kale Florentine. All-day treats include specialty sandwiches such as the Croque Monsieur and the PS.

The famed Double Chocolate Blackout Cake served with dark chocolate sauce is a definite must-try, though unique sweets such as the Flourless Orange Cake, PS. Ginger Brulee, and the Sticky Date Steamed Pudding are treats straight from dessert heaven that should earn well-deserved top spots on your go-to list as well.

The branch features the same, mouthwatering local-Western fusion cafe fare and intricate, laidback space. In fact, the cafe inhabits its own world within the iconic mall: the exterior resembles a greenhouse, with floor-to-ceiling glass windows, lush greenery, and PS.Cafe’s classic monochrome interior, creating a vibrant oasis in the heart of the central business district. \n\nEnjoy breakfast before starting the work day here with wholesome favourites such as the Breakfast Grand Slam Bunwich, the Almond & Chia Seed Granola, or PS.Cafe’s own twist of the local classic, the Kaya Toast, served with homemade organic ash white sourdough. With a cuppa or a Bellini in hand, dive right into the post-work hustle after tucking into stellar classics such as the irresistible PS. Brunch Burger, the Roasted Pork Belly Bap, not forgetting a side the famed Truffle Shoestring Fries. Alternatively, enjoy inventive takes on comfy local dishes with the PS. Prawn Noodle Soup and the PS. Crab & Prawn Laksa. Reward yourself after a tiring day with delish mains including the PS. Burger, the Tiger Beer-Battered Fish & Chips, and the iconic Crab Tart, where handpicked blue swimmers are pan-fried with chili and kaffir and drizzled with homemade harissa as well as a luscious prawn bisque sauce. On weekends, enjoy the same grub alongside the the PS. Fluffy Pancakes and the PS. Classic Benedict. \n\nYou haven’t been to PS.Cafe if you didn’t enjoy a slice of their delish cakes, though we reckon that one slice’s not gonna be enough. The famed Double Chocolate Blackout Cake served with dark chocolate sauce is a definite must-try, though unique sweets such as the Flourless Orange Cake, PS.

That and the delighted sounds of your fellow diners feasting on large plates of traditional Indonesian fare. It almost feels like you have left the hustle and bustle of the CBD and entered into a lively Indonesian village, with boisterous laughter filling the large oaken dining room, peppered with various traditional Indonesian curios. The simple, family-style seating adds to the feel of the place. Pagi Sore is your lunch or dinnertime escape from the urban jungle.\r\nAt the Far East Square outlet, subtle touches such as the display of Angklungs (a traditional Indonesian musical instrument) at the cashier counter, and little hand-carved wooden animals perched atop shelves add to the traditional feel of the place. Continuing in the vein of celebrating Indonesian culture, a rich tapestry woven with gold threads is also displayed at the front counter.\r\nWith its humble beginnings as a Nasi Padang stall, Pagi Sore has come a long way, but one thing still remains the same in all its 24 years - their sensational recipes that have drawn crowds for generations. Although Indonesian fare has a reputation of being too hot for most to handle, the tastes here have been slightly adjusted for the local palate, with a special focus on each of the five major flavours. In fact, as we journeyed through the menu, we appreciated the progression of sweet, savoury, sour, spicy and umami.\r\nThe bustling atmosphere when we visited is a testament to Pagi Sore's popularity, so be sure to make a reservation to guarantee yourself a seat. Otherwise, be ready to torturously watch as hungry patrons lap up plates of Indonesian goodness as you wait in line.

Established in 1956, and widely credited in the contested race of who was creator of the Singapore Chili Crab, Palm Beach has perfected its recipes and service over its long tenure. Whether you frequented the East Coast outlet back in the day with family, now visit for entertaining clients with local flair, or bring your out-of-town friends to One Fullerton for a meal and view to impress, it seems like we all know and love Palm Beach.\nTo those skeptics who hail a heartland hawker as more quintessentially Singaporean, we hear you. But once to have enjoyed succulent Black Pepper Crab and fresh squeezed fruit blends under crystal candelabras and the watchful eye of the Merlion, with a cooled interior to beat the heat, and a shiny, modern décor, we bet you will be a convert.\nSituated at the coveted spot where the Singapore River meets Marina Bay, views are second-to-none. While news of Palm Beach's greatness has drawn crowds from all over, our secret to avoid tourists is to be seated indoors. Expansive windows allow views to be just as idyllic, and we find that the temperature is more conducive to digging in to their various delicacies.\nAnd what delicacies there are! Sparing no expense in sourcing the freshest of seafood, vegetables and ingredients for house-made sauces, it is a pleasant surprise to see that price tags for dishes have seemingly not changed that much from 1956! Recipes have been fine-tuned since then, but classics like Sri Lankan crab prepared 11 different ways, and Honey Tangy Fish remain largely the same and will always be held close to our hearts, and stomachs.

The complementary menu of sharing plates from the famed Basilico and one Michelin-star Summer Palace will keep you coming back for more.\n\nDig into some Wild Mushroom Arancini With Saffron Mayonnaise. The fragrance of the exotic saffron gives this dish a uniquely sharp flavour. The earthiness of this dish is easily offset by a glass of sweet white wine. Diners who prefer some meat with their drinks can opt for Italian Cold Cuts. Perfect with a glass of red, this dish features fresh salami, crisp parma ham, cooked ham, and mortadella. Clueless about pairings? Ask one of the friendly staff for a recommendation.\n\nEnd the meal on a sweet note with the Praline Cake - a hazelnut and chocolate sponge cake made with Amedei dark chocolate.

If you've lived in Singapore for a while, chances are you've heard about Pasta Brava which was established in 1991. And it wouldn't be surprising if the name conjures up word associations like \"authentic Italian\", and \"delicious\".\r\nEast truly meets west as the Luceri family serves traditional Italian dishes at a conservation shophouse in Tanjong Pagar. With its central location, it's perfect for corporate lunches or romantic dinners, and if you don't believe us, perhaps the numerous accolades that take up an entire wall near the entrance can back up our claim.\r\nThey deserve a standing ovation and a \"Bravissima!\" for their simple yet delicious renditions, many of whose ingredients can be counted on one hand like the Insalata Caprese and Calamari Fritti. The extensive menu has you covered from antipasti to dolci, but as their name suggests, the homemade pastas are their specialty.\r\nConsider their signature dish, the Mezzelune Ripiene di Zucca. Half moon shaped pumpkin ravioli comes in a divine red capsicum cream sauce. At first bite, you get the sweetness of the pumpkin, which is then finished off with the sweetness of the red capsicum. Between this and their chocolate lava cake, we're hard-pressed to choose which the sweeter escape is.

Then move on to the pasta because, my oh my, is it divine. Select your favourite pasta from egg-based fettucine to rigatoni and pair it with any of the 18 rich and flavourful sauces available. Stellar options include the Al Ragu, where the traditional chunky beef sauce is slowly cooked overnight. The Mixed Seafood sauce is another crowd-pleaser, with its generous heaping of prawns, mussels, and squid all lightly cooked in a seafood broth. And what better way to round off the meal than with a glass of Italian wine from the eatery’s wine cellar?\n\nSet in a warm and cosy environment, the humble Pastaria Abate charms with delightful renditions of classic Italian pasta meals at wallet-friendly prices.

If you’re a fan of beef, then opt for Nua Yang. Here, a tender 300 days grain-fed Australian beef tenderloin is cooked to perfection and paired with a tangy spicy tamarind sauce. Patara Fine Thai Cuisine also does not lack for any seafood options, ranging from fresh lobsters, prawns, to several kinds of fish, so you won’t go wrong with any pick. For us, the Whole Seabass cannot be beat thanks to its complementary broth concocted from lime, garlic, and chilli.\nBold, zesty Thai flavours are on full display here at Patara Fine Thai Cuisine, an eatery that stands out among the best Thai spots in the city.

The Brauhaus is also a stellar Bavarian restaurant, churning out plates of meaty German favourites to go with those beers, as well as heaps of friendly German “Geselligkeit,” or “sociability”. \n\nChanneling an authentic German tavern, the trappings here are gorgeous and rustic, and usher you into a truly German experience. The food does the rest. The great classics of the cuisine are all here, including a massive Roasted Whole Pork Knuckle on the bone, served with tart Sauerkraut and Bavarian bread dumplings. There’s also German meatloaf, called Leberkas, served grilled with a side of fresh cucumber salad, a sunny side up egg, and rich Bavarian mustard. Deep from the heart of Bavaria comes the Beef Beer Goulash, a rich beef stew given extra layers of flavour by some dark beer, served with mounds of Bavarian egg noodles to soak up all that delicious gravy. \n\nIt’s not German food without an entire section of the menu dedicated to sausages, and here you can get your fix of Currywurst, Munich Weisswurst, and herby Sausage Snail. Pile on the meat with a serving of Schnitzel, a battered cutlet of pork or chicken, served with a variety of sauces that will forever change your mind about German food being bland and uninteresting. Needless to say, chug down some beers. They’re brewed on-site and are some of the tastiest on the island.

It sits behind a glassed-in kitchen, bustling with chefs pressing dough and boiling pasta. The window is a theme at the restaurant, its storefront also featuring floor-to-ceiling versions that allows light and action to flow from inside to outside beautifully. The rest of the design is as if stepping into the mind of a graphic designer, complete with techy textures of chrome and wire, along with charming infographic posters displaying optimal wine and beer pairings. It’s a refreshingly minimal, but not understyled look that shows a new side to the tired hipster aesthetic, and a very unexpected one for a pizza restaurant. \n\nLet the posters guide you to your ideal beverage, picking from the small but efficient bar of beers and wines on tap. From the menu, the pizzas are the obvious choice, in which you can taste the handiwork of that impressive oven.  The Funghi Scarmorza features a woodsy mix of mushrooms with a drizzle of truffle oil and rich melted cheese that’s an immediate palate pleaser. The Prosciutto Crudo con Rucola is another winner with more than the usual volume of toppings of Parma ham and peppery rocket suspended in a milky mozzarella. The Vegetariana has the same cheese, which is cut nicely by balsamic grilled eggplant, capsicum and zucchini. All the pizzas are grounded by a tasty crust, chewy in the center and bubbled and scorched at the edges. A variety of pastas is also available for the non-pizza straggler of your dining party. Cap off the meal with a heavenly scented, creamy Saffron Panna Cotta and you won’t be disappointed!

That would mean little, however, if the food wasn’t authentic and delicious, but fret not - the restaurant’s commitment to good food is obvious from the very first bite. That, together with a relaxed ambience and attentive service staff, makes for a meal to remember.\n\nIf you’re looking to have a little taste of Greece, then dig into a large helping of Moussaka, an oven-baked casserole made of grilled eggplant, minced beef, decadently creamy cheese, and various spices. Hot, rich, and a real belly buster, it’d be a rare person who didn’t come away from it feeling satisfied. Do try the Grilled Stuffed Squid with Feta Cheese as well – every chewy mouthful is enhanced by the fragrance of sliced garlic. It’s not an overly complicated dish, but man if it isn’t good.\n\nPlace to READ doesn’t just serve Greek food – there’s a great selection of pastas and pizzas too, among other Western fare. You won’t regret the Chilli Crab Sauce Pasta, with an authentic take on the sauce that won’t disappoint fans of the Singaporean classic. Served with helpings of scallop and shrimp, you’re sure to get every cent of your money’s worth. Hearty, good value, and a good place to unwind – that just about sums up Place to READ!

Its roots date back to the social enterprise Arpanam, which was started by the Nadathur family who was involved in the founding of technology giant Infosys. The menu boasts an array of light bites bursting with flavour at pocket-friendly prices. All proceeds from sales go directly into supporting local artists and cultural programs.  \r\n\r\nDig in to one of their Medhu Vadais, a crispy, deep-fried savoury donut. Made with urad dal and rice, as well as a special mix of spices, these little bites of heaven come with coconut chutney, giving them a spicy kick. For something a little moreish, opt for the Idli-Vadai combination. The Idli is made with ground rice batter that is steamed to fluffy perfection.

There is also a selection of cheeses and other dishes for diners’ pairings. \n\nWith a walk-in cellar home to over a thousand bottles of carefully procured wines and a bottle list that changes weekly, this is one place that truly knows its grapes. Wines are sold by the glass using the Enomatic and Coravin wine preservation systems, which minimises spoilage of the wine. The knowledgeable sommeliers are also able to advise diners and make recommendations for different palates. \n\nDiners can pair their choice of wine with farmhouse cheese platters and truffle honey. The tarte flambee is another good option, and comes with a range of premium toppings, including roma tomatoes and gruyere cheese. For something a little moreish, opt for the Stockyard Wagyu Ribeye. The fresh cut of beef is cooked to your liking and slathered in a rich beef demi glace sauce which gives the dish a strong flavour without overpowering the taste of the meat.

The sprawling portico is outfitted in bamboo, teak and concrete, channeling the organic feel of the characteristic CHIJMES greenery. The simple lines and casual furnishings offer a roomy backyard feel, but elevated with design-centric touches, so it's more of what we would imagine Gwyneth Paltrow's back lawn to be like rather than our next-door neigbour's. Vintage green brick and terracotta tiles are reflected from the rattan-clad mirrors, all cast with a romantic glow come nighttime. The set-up, along with the varied menu, allow Prive to be a great spot for both brunch with the family, or an after work hangout with friends.\r\n\r\nThe menu has brought along the most-loved dishes from Keppel Bay including Eggs Benedict, crispy Fish & Chips we can't seem to get out of our heads, satisfying Impossible Meat burgers, and divine Sticky Date Pudding. Being added to the mix are stone-baked pizzas, hearty brunch as well as local favourites like the Heura Hainanese Chicken Rice and Traditional Chicken Curry. If you prefer snacking, then the selection of bar food, including Breaded Crab Cakes and Crispy Chicken Wings are ideally suited to enjoy with the extensive range of cocktails, affordable beers and wines. Drop by for happy hour from 5pm to 8pm daily and relax in the garden with an ice-cold drink in hand.

Qi Lai Feng aims to enhance the hotpot dining experience with the unique “muscle fish”. A type of fish that is grown under strict conditions with a specific diet, its taste is similar to pork belly — firm, chewy, and delectable. Available exclusively at Qi Lai Feng, they’ve centred their menu and dishes around it with dry pots, soup pots, and side dishes.\r\n\r\nThe Mala Fish Pot is a great option for diners looking for a kick. Made with fish, Sichuan peppercorns, and chilli, this fiery dish has the searing flavours Singaporeans have come to love, made richer by the addition of silky fish. Top it with noodles and meat to soak up the broth for the perfect meal. For something a little milder, try the Tomato Fish Pot. Sweeter and tangier than Mala, the tomato in this soup gives the dish a rich and subtle flavour that goes well with rice. Try the Collagen Q Fish Ribs soup. Clear and packed with nutrients, this mainstay of hotpot is also available here, made with fish instead.

The elaborate sauces and flavours of French cuisine meet the à la minute robustness of Chinese cooking, with each cuisine getting half of the menu, allowing diners to create a fascinating fusion meal unlike any other. Helmed by famed Executive Chef Jean-Charles Dubois, this restaurant spreads out over four live cooking stations that turn locally-sourced and organically-grown produce into elegant plates, a truly unique hotel buffet experience. There is also an à la carte menu that sprawls the full gamut of these two rich cuisines. In this fashion, you may see a classic pot-roasted French hen, a corn-fed beauty cooked in a pot with French potatoes and vegetables served up with a plate of stir-fried Frog Legs in a fiery Szechuan sauce. Or a beautifully slow-braised Wagyu Cheek served alongside crunchy Sweet & Sour Kurobuta Pork, or scallion-kissed wok-fried Angus Beef Cubes.\nBoth cuisines unite in their love for seafood. On the French side, there’s a massive platter of premium Fruits de Mer (fruits of the sea), including Alaskan king crab, freshly shucked oysters, and scallop carpaccio on an iced platter. On the Chinese side, the ubiquitous Abalone, except here served sashimi-style with a sea urchin sauce and a sprinkling of lemony breadcrumbs. Dessert is a grab-bag of options: delicate French gateaux flavoured with strawberries, dark chocolate, or praline rub shoulders with Asian flavours like red bean, yuzu, and mango sticky rice. The quality of cooking is truly unmatched, and who knows, you may discover some delicious food pairings for yourself at this culinary wonderland. Come experience one of the island’s most exciting fusion experiences today!

The original red house was a bastion for just-caught fish and crustaceans, delivered fresh from local fishing boats. The crimson-coloured facade was a symbol of prosperous and communal dining, further adorned with traditional red lanterns.\r\nNow, the Prinsep outlet has very few red-coloured accoutrements, as the decor takes on a more understated look. For a casual step up from the outdoor seafood restaurants, this incarnation of Red House fits the bill perfectly, favouring simple functionality over flair. The one red item that's not going anywhere though, is their famed Chilli Crab, and with good reason. While there's much debate over which recipe reigns supreme in Singapore, Red House is consistently named among the top contenders. Here, the spicy gravy tastes especially homemade and doesn't mask the freshness of the crab.\r\nWith a bilingual menu written in both English and Chinese, Red House Seafood offers patrons a wealth of seafood options split into categories, all kept at more reasonable price points than you may expect.

Then there’s the Japanese Chashu Rice Set, think ramen turned into a rice dish, with sweet glazed chashu served with freshly steamed rice. For a little zi-char comfort, order the Frog Leg Hor Fun, smoky wok-fried rice noodles tossed up with tender frog legs, spring onions, and lots of fiery ginger in a rich soy-based sauce.

At its helm is Chef Masahiro Takada, who has established himself as a trailblazer and a creator of superb Japanese-Italian fare. With a strong emphasis on the freshness of ingredients used, Chef Takada ensures the extraordinary standard and quality of his food. The restaurant uses fresh seafood, such as Hokkaido scallops and sea urchin, which are imported directly from the famed Tsukiji market in Tokyo.\nThe squid ink taglioni topped with sea urchin is sublime, with the combination of ingredients releasing a delightful blend of flavours on the taste buds. We also highly recommend the Wagyu tenderloin steak which is cooked to perfection, bringing out the full magnificent texture of the beef. These are all found on the July 2016 dinner menu, and are just a few examples of Chef Takada’s varied and exquisitely unique creations.\nLet your dining experience be elevated further by the simple, chic decor that speaks of subtle elegance. The soothing jazz music and minimalist aesthetic create a great ambience that complements the meal perfectly. Japanese-Italian cuisine might not be quite as well-known as Japanese-French fare, but we definitely recommend giving Ristorante Takada a go!

With a view of the glittering Central Business District skyline, together with its stellar food and service, it is no wonder that Rosso Vino is popular with families, businessmen, and couples alike.  \n\nThe food menu is a cornucopia of delicious Italian dishes. The Chicken Parmigiana is another crowd-pleaser. Pan seared breaded chicken breast is topped with generous helpings of cloud-soft mozzarella cheese and tangy tomato sauce. The Calzone Rossovino is a folded pizza stuffed with tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, pork ham, and mushrooms. A bite into it is enough to send you to food heaven. Desserts are equally tempting. A host of Italian classics such as Panna Cotta, Crème Caramel, and Torta Lava Con Gelato Alla Vaniglia are available.

Barbecued Shrimp, Sizzlin’ Jumbo Scallops, their signature Blue Crab Cakes; all good reminders that there’s more to this steak house than just beef. Go a little further, however, and you’ll strike gold: custom-aged Midwestern beef that come in all sorts of cuts, from Ribeye and Porterhouse to Petite Filet for those with a smaller appetite. Pair your juicy, perfectly grilled steaks – which come on a piping hot plate – with a Bleu Cheese Crust, get it Oscar Style with crab cakes, asparagus, and béarnaise sauce, or throw your diet plan out and add on other succulent mains such as Fresh Lobster or an Ahi-Tuna Stack.

Several roast meats take the menu here, one notable dish being the tender and juicy SHAO Signature Roast Platter, comprising a mix of the restaurant’s roast duck and roast pork. The restaurant also spins up an amazing Crispy Roast Suckling Pig that’s crispy yet succulent in all the right places.\n\nBut that’s not all!

True to Chef Drew’s personal cooking philosophy of Minimal Wastage, the menu encapsulates the essence of Sustainable Cooking where every part of a single produce is pushed to its maximum potential.Diners are transported to a utopia of Sustainable Cuisine, starting from the table setting with a cutlery holder made from recycled abalone shells; to a pictorial guide detailing how each by-product are used, and lastly, the fine flavours from Chef Drew’s enthralling take on sustainable cooking.\r\nDrew grew up on his family farm near Brisbane, Australia where it first ignited his passion for cooking. He spent most of his childhood working the farm and attributes his cooking style and philosophy to his time at the farm. Coupled with hard work, passion, and dedication to his craft, Drew’s personal cooking philosophy of Minimal Wastage forms the cornerstone of Salted & Hung.\r\nThe 7 & 10 course menu showcases Chef Drew’s clever manoeuvre of ingredients and his vision for a Sustainable kitchen.\r\nThe signature dish on the menu is the Aged Turbot served on a wooden board with three elements, namely the ‘Turbot’, ‘Turbot Tea Broth’ and ‘Turbot Liver Vin Jaune’ sauce. The 5-days aged Turbot is stuffed with Mushroom Duxelles that has been slow-cooked for 8 hours. The skin and turbot trimmings will be fermented into a garam that is later used to season the fish. The dish is then finished off with a sauce made from the Turbot liver and Vin Jaune. Lastly, the turbot bones are hung and dried for 14 days in preparation for its role in making a dashi broth, along with local herbs and flowers lending an aromatic flavour to the dashi tea. These three elements will come together when presented tableside by our server.\r\nNext, the Kagoshima A4 Wagyu presents a sirloin steak grilled over Japanese Bincho-tan paired with carrots. The carrots presented on the dish are prepared in a process that spans over 24 hours. First, the carrots are confit in excess beef fat from the Wagyu, then slow-cooked, dried and rehydrated with beef sauce. The rest of the carrot trimmings goes into making a smoked carrot ketchup. Lastly, the sauces finishing touches consists of a charcoal powder derived from onion and leek trimmings, and pear and shiitake mushroom reduction made from vegetable trimmings.\r\nThe final pièce de resistance El Toro Orchard is Chef Drew’s tribute to his family farm in Stanthorpe, Queensland. The farm is founded in 1945 and tended by generations of the Nocente family. The orchard mainly bears Granny Smith apples, Gala apples and Red Delicious apples. The dessert presents an Apple Tartin that resembles an apple dropped on the Orchard ground. The Apple Tartin is caramelised and compressed with cider, and filled with apple jam. The dessert is paired with chocolate twigs and mascarpone ice-cream.\r\nThe Tasting Menu is available for dinner from Tuesdays to Sundays.

The star of this restaurant is the laksa soup -- a rich and spicy concoction that comes with an extra bowl of laksa leaves for you to add as you wish. While it’s tempting to slurp up the gravy on its own, San Laksa Steamboat offers a wide variety of fresh seafood, vegetables, and meat for you to amp up your hot pot experience. \r\n\r\nStart with local vegetables such as kang kong, Chinese lettuce, and a mixed platter of mushrooms to infuse sweetness into the soup. Love cheese? The cheese tofu is a popular item here, where a square of fermented beancurd hides a lovely, cheesy middle. And no laksa soup can be complete without an order of tau pok — the spongy beancurd skin is the perfect way to sop up all the richness of the laksa broth. \r\n\r\nFor meats, try the fresh prawns or wafer-thin slices of pork collar. Diners who prefer more seafood in their hot pot can opt for the fresh toman fillet. Round up a scrumptious dinner experience with an order of handmade minced meatballs, laced with tiny bits of water chestnut for that added crunch.

A popular favourite is the Chicken Chimichangas, where diced chicken, cheese, and black beans are stuffed into a flour tortilla that is then deep-fried to a perfect golden-brown. The deep-fried burrito is chock-full of tender meat and stringy cheese, and is pure indulgence with every bite. Also good are the Tacos, which diners get to customise. Pick from hard or soft shell tortillas, then choose your favourite filling — Chimichurri Chicken, Fish with Mango Salsa, Avocado Prawn, Pulled Pork, or Vegetables. The Fish with Mango Salsa is a healthy yet delicious treat, where fork-tender cubes of fish are tossed with a tangy and refreshing mango salsa.  \r\n\r\nCraving for a meaty feast? The signature sizzling-hot fajitas will more than satisfy! Choose from the regular Chicken or Beef, or the super-indulgent Wagyu-Angus and Iberico Pork options.

Don't be too quick to dismiss the quality of the food before you tuck in though, the multitude of classical techniques used to create their particular brand of contemporary French fare are a testament to the professional training of the chefs.Begin with a starter of Saveur's Pasta before moving on to main plates like Beef Bourguignon, Chicken Roulade, and the signature Duck Confit. Rounding off the relatively compact menu are sweet treats like the Pistachio Panna Cotta which sound too good to pass up. It's difficult to believe this eatery had their first debut in a humble coffeeshop! Saveur's one-two punch of French flavours, tweaked to suit the local palate, and reasonable prices will leave you salivating for more. It's no wonder, then, that lines can sometimes extend out the doors.

Here, they believe that steaming is the best way to cook seafood while retaining the most of its nutrients and flavours, and have developed a novel method that combines the theatre of table-side cooking with the advantages of steaming.\n\nYou choose from an extensive menu of fresh seafood, ranging from super premium sea-critters like Australian Jade Tiger Abalone, the house signature, oysters, and sea urchin, to less sinful options like prawns, bamboo clams, and sea bass. On top of seafood, red meat and vegetables turn this into a full food-pyramid situation, though it’s the seafood that truly makes the meal, especially as the taste of the ocean gradually flavours a tureen of porridge sitting underneath the steamer. Perfect for groups looking for a super festive dinner, dinner here is filled with rich oceany aromas and umami flavours in your mouth, making this one of the most exciting seafood experiences in town.

Dine al-fresco and people-watch, or head indoors to enjoy the friendly ambience of this culinary gem.\nThat Shabestan's Executive Chef Hamid Hosseini obsession with fine ingredients is apparent - there is nothing artificial in the flavours that combine to make each dish.

There is also a wide variety of seafood items. The Sichuan Kung Pao Prawn is made with a generous portion of spice for that mouth-numbing spice that Singaporeans have come to love.

But at Shashlik, it's also the comforting flavours that have kept customers returning over the years, starting with the pillowy dinner rolls and butter that greet you at the table, and following through to entrees like French Onion Soup, a meaty beef broth enriched with caramelized onions and a crusty cheese croute, or endearingly 60s appetizers like Egg Millionaire - chopped boiled egg, bacon bits, and parmesan gratin served in little egg cups. There's even Blinis & Caviar, served with sour cream, if you're feeling especially indulgent before your main.\nWe'd hold back on the appetizers though, because the shashlik, or meat grilled on skewers served straight up at the table, is very hearty. There's the classic Shashlik of Beef, juicy tenderloin rich with the flavours of a 24-hour marinade, as well as pork, chicken, and lamb. If you like your meat cooked more conventionally, there's also grilled steaks. But one of our favourite ways of eating meat here is in one of Shashlik's classic old-world stews: hearty, rustic Oxtail Stew and creamy Beef Stroganoff, perfect with some crusty bread or rice, and a heart full of nostalgia. For dessert: Baked Alaska, no question.\nThe food here may seem a little too quaint for the 21st century, but really that's part of the charm, and a rapidly disappearing one at that. So book a table while you can!

The table-side acrobatics of its Japan-trained chefs has become a part of the meal as the delicious flash-cooked dishes made from fresh ingredients. The menu has since expanded to include sushi and sashimi dishes to go along with the hot plates, satisfying that Japanese cuisine craving of yours under one roof.\nThe classic Teppanyaki menu features a range of premium meats cooked before your eyes to perfection. Fatty tenderloin of Wagyu, chicken thigh, buttery foie gras, live lobster, and tender salmon belly sizzle on the pan, releasing their delicious aromas as a teaser to the meal. Mounds of garlicky fried rice and fresh vegetables follow, mopping up the meaty juices for a taste of perfection. If you want to beef up your meal, order some hand rolls that are studded with everything from chopped tuna belly to braised unagi, or get a platter of sashimi to ramp up all those umami flavours swirling about in your mouth. If you hate choosing, meals here come in elegant Kaiseki-style sets, where you let the chefs prepare the meal at a luxurious pace that will leave you bursting at the seams. Everyone loves a good, smoky teppanyaki dinner, and here you get to pair that with sushi for a complete Japanese night out!

Served with a generous helping of noodles, a soft boiled egg, and flavourful duck broth topped with mushrooms and tofu, this is the perfect meal to enjoy with a glass of sake. The little things are just as well-executed as the mains. The Chawanmushi is an instagram-friendly dish of egg topped with a traditional fishcake and Ikura. The Sukiyaki Udon is another excellent option. Hearty and served with thin, perfectly-cooked slices of meat, this is a great choice for diners looking for a filling lunch.

The word Shinzo means heart in Japanese. Having spent more than 39 years honing his skills as a sushi shokunin (sushi artisan), Chef Patrick Tan knows that the best sushi is made from the heart.\r\nChef Tan takes great pride in making sure he maintains an intimate setting in his sushi bar. He wants every seat in the house to be the best so that guests have full view of their personal chefs in working on their creations. Chef Tan believes that this is one of the highlights of the Shinzo experience. He is a perfectionist who is known for shaping the culture at many renowned fine dining Japanese restaurants in Singapore, including the Sushi Jin by Les Amis Group, Nogawa and Sushi Chiharu.\r\nAt Shinzo, one can expect nothing less than the freshest ingredients flown in directly from Japan. Just as the ingredients varies with the seasons in Japan, so does Shinzo’s menu. Chef Tan constantly pushes the envelope of culinary creativity, such as fusing non-Japanese ingredients like foie gras and century egg with traditional Japanese cuisine. (Jun 2020)","images":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251039_19032.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2014/04/s-725x360x80xo_Restaurant_Interior_jpg_1397014910.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251039_48815.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251040_80702.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251040_61062.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251041_92084.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251041_42606.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251042_34509.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251042_96511.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2021/04/s-725x360x80xo_1617251066_11522.jpg?date=202106080907"]},{"title":"Shiok Garden","Cuisine":"American, Buffet, Chinese, Seafood, Steamboat, BBQ","Menus":"","Hours":"Mon-Sun: 11am-11pm","Price":"$$","Good For":"Al Fresco, Casual Dining, Kid Friendly, Drinks, Private Functions","Location":"Woodlands","Address":"31 Riverside RoadAdmiralty ParkSingapore (739087)                                                Map","Address Link":"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1.4438819,103.7817596&query_place_id=ChIJAa4qZXsT2jEROE2EUzlnpK8","DISHES WE LOVE":"BBQ Sambal Stingray, Fish Soup Noodle, Classic Dessert Chendol, Thai Ice Milk Tea","ABOUT":"A hotpot and BBQ buffet restaurant that serves up an interesting selection of fresh seafood, ingredients, cooked food and beverages, tuck into a hearty feast of Asian favourites with family and friends here at Shiok Garden.

Perhaps, 'joint' isn't the right word; after all, a restaurant which boasts an austere elegance and a pricey omakase menu deserves more formality. It's a venture with the founder of three Michelin star Sushi Shikon - folks who've been to this Mercer Hotel establishment in Hong Kong will likely remember its jaw-dropping price tag - so excellent Japanese food is to be expected.\nLike most Japanese places which take pride in authenticity, ingredients are flown in from Tsukiji Market daily and used to great effect in the Master Chef's impressive array of omakase dishes. Let's just say that wobbling out of Shoukouwa is a possibility once you've finished two appetisers, three assorted sashimi, four cooked dishes, 13 pieces of nigiri sushi, miso soup, Japanese omelette, and dessert. The cooked dishes are great but the stars of the show are, without a doubt, the premium seafood. Slices bear none of that heavy, fishy aroma, but remain slightly salty and very sweet - as all fresh catch should be. If you're looking to be hypnotised by a vast array of dishes made in front of your eyes and impeccably fresh seafood, look no further than this incredibly intimate and meditative sushi restaurant.

Established in 2004, the flagship restaurant has been delighting diners with Sichuan classics for over a decade. The dishes here combine a variety of cuisines - from Huaiying to Cantonese, with dishes ranging from spicy Pepper Chicken to soothing soups.\n\nThe popular Mala Hotpot has its roots in Sichuan cuisine, so it’s no surprise that dishes on the menu come with an extra kick. Spice fanatics will love the Mala Crab for its searing heat levels and generous portions of crab meat. Diners who prefer something less fiery can opt for the delicious Chicken Pudding - a delectable dish of meat and herbs that is perfect on a cold day. The Marinated Pig’s Trotter is another Sichuan dish that features tender pork meat soaked in a flavourful blend of herbs and spices and cooked to perfection.\n\nThe premium ingredients and fancy interior may seem too plush for some, but don’t be fooled - this restaurant is as wallet-friendly as it gets, so patrons can indulge without fear of breaking the bank.

Nestled cosily in the trendy yet historic corner of Stanley Street is Shukuu Izakaya, a trendy hotspot featuring a bevy of eclectic small plates that will tickle taste buds. The intimate space features iconic red lanterns and a traditional Japanese mural to create a chic vibe that makes the experience so authentic. Whether you’re looking for an eatery with friends or just a quiet, solitary dinner after work, the superb yet reasonably-priced fare gives you the perfect reason to let your hair down.\n\nStaying true to their conviction of serving only high quality food, ingredients are sourced from leading Japanese suppliers and air-flown in fresh from Japan. The dishes here remains true to its Japanese roots while tinkling with Western influences. The Kani Gratin, or crab gratin with mentaiko, and the Rosti Mentai, where swiss-style potato shreds are drizzled with a decadent mentaiko sauce, serve as fine testaments. Shukuu Izakaya’s specialty, Kushiyaki, or charcoal-grilled skewered meat, is a must-try as well. The Omi Wagyu as well as the Kurobuta Tontoro are your best bets. For the more adventurous, the Yaki Gyu Tan, where premium beef tongue is grilled to tender perfection is sure to please as well. \n\nThe dishes here taste best when paired with sake, so choose your partner in crime from their extensive range of sakes or ask for a recommendation, and voilà, the meal’s perfect!

Shunjuu Izakaya, situated along the beautiful Robertson Quay, adds a refreshing spritz of excitement to the modern Izakaya with their specialty in Sumiyaki, charcoal-grilled dishes which may very well be the Japanese answer to tapas.\n\nWe love the al-fresco dining space but if you’re looking for some air-conditioned comfort, the wood-filled interior and cosy booths provides a much-welcomed respite. When it comes to food, expect well-executed Japanese favourites with an emphasis on dishes that pair well with sake or shochu. As with tapas, the dishes are served as small plates made for sharing, so don’t go easy on the ordering! All 70 of their sumiyaki signatures such as the Tori Kawa Ninniku (garlic rolled with chicken skin), Tebasaki (chicken wings), Gyu Tan (ox tongue) are not to be missed of course. Cold dishes such as the Tako Wasabi (seasoned baby octopus) , the Sashimi Sarada (sashimi salad), and Tori Kawa Masago Ae (chicken skin mixed with cod roe) are also as delicious as hot plates such as the Buta Kimuchi Itame (stir-fry pork and kimchee) and the Ribuai Tataki (ribeye carparccio).\n\nFor some carbs, opt for some Soba or the delicious Ninniku Cha-han (garlic fried rice). Wash it all down with sake or shochu - a wide selection awaits, along with a detailed table which specifies the serving temperature, the prefecture of origin, and the sake meter, allowing you to make the most informed choice. We suggest you try a few. It can’t hurt, can it?

A wide array of authentic Sichuan and Cantonese fare is offered here, with a menu that stretches more than 30 pages long. Yet, quality is not compromised, and every dish boasts nuanced flavours that will tinkle with your taste buds.\nContrary to popular belief, Sichuan cuisine isn't defined by a fiery spiciness that requires a glass of water nearby at all times. We are major fans of their Sichuan Dan Dan Noodles, but that's just the tip of the iceberg. Expect dishes like the Marinated Black Chinese Fungus with Preserved Chilli, the Braised Sea Cucumber in Sichuan Bean Paste, and the delicate Boiled Sliced Fish in Sichuan Pepper Sauce to blow you away with their smorgasbord of robust flavours.\nTheir Cantonese classics are similarly executed with finesse. The highlight is undoubtedly the dim sum here where diners are treated with an eclectic mix of old favourites and innovative creations, but double-boiled soups like the Chicken Soup with \"Lingzhi\" and dishes such as the Braised Seafood Treasures with Sliced Abalone warrant a return trip.

The restaurant's management staff replied, \"Sichuan spicy!\" Normally we would discount that reply as pure marketing trickery, but after trying the dishes for ourselves, we were instant believers.\nWelcome to Si Chuan Dou Hua, bringing you authentic Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine from its perch on the top floor of UOB Plaza 1. Complete with chefs imported in from Sichuan and Hong Kong in addition to martial arts-and-dance-trained traditional tea pourers from Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, this place is as real as it gets, folks!\nAlthough there are three outlets in Singapore, each boasting a different menu that caters to a specific clientele, the UOB location is best known for its 30% Sichuan and 70% Cantonese split menu. This makes it ideal for hosting clients since it's probably best to avoid the faux pas of entertaining guests while drenched in a fearsome chili-induced sweat.\nIn addition to abalone-themed set meals and Sichuan-style high tea, the restaurant also features an expansive list of high end teas imported from various regions in China.

Whether it is a tucking into a bubbling pot of fish head curry, or scouring for the best sambal for our nasi lemak, we flock to spicy foods like moths to a flame. That’s why we’re head over heels for Si Wei Mao Cai, a humble Sichuan restaurant located in Chinatown that reigns supreme with its fiendishly spicy foods. \n\nReady to set your tongue ablaze? Then we highly recommend diving into a pot of Si Wei Stewed Beef in Hot Szechuan Pepper Sauce. Adventurous eaters should not miss the restaurant’s rendition of Si Wei Chilli Frog where tender frog legs are stir-fried in a blend of fresh and dried chillies. Then wash down the spiciness with the mild vinegary Pickled Vegetables with Beef, or any number of Chinese wines and liquors available here. If you ask us, we personally can’t say no to a cold glass of Hai Zi Lan or a Mao Tai. \n\nAside from its delectable dishes, Si Wei Mao Cai also prides itself on its top-notch service. And honestly, we’re bowled over not only by the incredibly polite and efficient wait staff, but the kitchen who tries to accommodate any requests for Sichuan dishes not on the menu.

We love kicking the meal off with a zesty Scallop Salad made better with the addition of oranges, strawberries, cherry tomatoes on a bed of lettuce and baby spinach. Meat-lovers can partake in some quality meats, with well-crafted mains such as the Five Spice Lamb Rack where lamb marinated in Chinese spices is cleverly paired with a smoky barbecue sauce.

Slappy Cakes by the Tung Lok Group is all about making your pancakes, and eating them too. The set-up is simple: a table with a built-in, non-stick griddle, and jars of golden syrup at the side to go with the pancakes. Purists will go for classic batter flavours like buttermilk, while adventurous souls will enjoy the wide variety of batter flavours such as peanut butter, chocolate and even zucchini. Fill your pancakes with sweet strawberries or chocolate chips, or go the savoury path with pork sausages and roasted mushrooms. \n\nYou don’t need to know how to cook to make your pancakes, either. Simply squeeze the batter out onto the griddle, dress it up how you like it, and flip the pancakes with the spatula provided. Not a pancake fan? Slappy Cakes also serves up hearty all-day breakfast items. Popular favourites include The Classic Breakfast of scrambled eggs with crispy bacon, toasted brioche and breakfast potatoes, and the Country Fried Steak — a crispy and juicy serving of battered chicken.

And at Smokey's BBQ, the down to earth, open air, go-to place for American-style ribs, that's exactly what you get. This isn't your simple poolside open brick pit with charcoal. In fact, Smokey's use a custom built smoker, imported wood from the States, and a homemade dry rub, all for that ultimate barbecue experience. Endorsed by our very own in-house token Texan, Smokey's BBQ is THE place to go for delicious ribs, beer, and an old-fashioned good time.\nThe homemade sauces complement the dishes perfectly, and when coupled with the rich smoky flavour of the meat, it's impossible to resist picking the bones clean. For the perfect barbecue experience though, you'll need to wash all that meat down with some ice cold beer! There's beer on tap, imported craft beers by the bottle, and even a selection of wines from the walk-in wine cellar. Suffice to say, you won't be leaving hungry or thirsty.\nAs one of the owners so eloquently said, the secret to Smokey's is simply that they love the food they serve, and serve the food they love.

It's not all Dim Sum, Laksa and Satay, however! End the meal on a sweet note with their Blueberry Cheesecake and Chocolate Fountain. Morning, noon, or night, Spices Cafe has an endless rotation of exciting fare to whet your appetite.

Spicy House Restaurant certainly pulls no punches in serving quality, fiercely authentic, Chengdu-style hotpot. The chain has its origins in Shanghai and the outlet in Riverside Point is its first overseas branch; unique to the Singapore outlet is the mouthwatering addition of Japanese wagyu beef and Australian lobster (plus some others) to the menu.\n\nThe restaurant’s signature soup base is the Mala Butter, which has a distinctively rich flavour courtesy of the butter stirred into the soup. You’d be hard-pressed to forget the taste of this particular base, which possesses a complexity that not many other places can produce. If you’re looking for something different, however, you can choose from a list of soup bases such as Tomato, Pig’s Trotters, and Chestnut Healthy Chicken, among others. Some ready-to-eat side dishes include flavourful Sichuan Dumplings as well as Mala Noodles, for those who feel like having something apart from hotpot. It quickly becomes apparent that there’s something in this restaurant for everyone,  especially for those who like their food extra spicy, so make your way down to Spicy House Restaurant – you definitely won’t regret it!

Opened in 1929, the establishment has seen more than one venue (think the well-known Great World Amusement Park), and today one can find it located in a beautifully preserved heritage shophouse along Upper Cross Street. A restaurant that has remained open for this long surely has something good going for it, and you certainly won’t regret a visit!\n\nLose yourself in the variety of sets offered on the menu. There’s a particular set for one person that we’re pretty fond of, with its plethora of seafood eats. Luxuriate in a serving of Stewed Boston Lobster in Fresh Fungus in Superior Stock, a tasty dish made with delightfully fresh helpings of lobster you’ll be remembering for days to come. The Crisp Fried Fillet of Cod Fish with BBQ Sauce is another dish that’s easy to love – perfectly crispy on the outside with firm, fresh cod on the inside, you’d be hard-pressed to stop yourself from guzzling it all down in a rush! There are other sets available that are pretty damn good too, and anyone who gets a taste of the restaurant’s comfort food offerings will immediately understand why it has remained open for business through the decades.

The menu here is dedicated to authentic Swabian classics such as Pork Knuckle, Speciality Sausages, and Spatzle. Whether you’re a newbie to German cuisine or a seasoned connoisseur, there’s sure to be something for you. With fine upholstery, lively music, and welcoming staff, Bavaria is just but a meal away. \r\n\r\nYou can’t go wrong with the Pork Knuckle. Crisp on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside, this dish is amazingly tasty. Pair it with one of the beers imported straight from Stuttgart and you’ll get a truly authentic Swabian feast. There is also a wide selection of wines for diners who prefer alternatives. The Speciality Sausages are another hot favourite, and for good reason. Choose between beef, chicken, or pork sausages, which are dressed up with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. The gravy is lightly spicy and adds flavour to the generous portion of sausages. The Chicken Spatzle with White Wine Sauce is a boozy dish that is perfect for ravenous diners looking for a decadent dish.

Large and shiny, it produces skewer after skewer of succulent meat grilled expertly right in front of you. Sumire hails from a long tradition of yakitori in Japan, and this is clear in its extensive menu, which showcases different parts of the humble chicken, from its shoulder to its thigh. Sumire’s meatballs are very popular for their savory balance of juicy flavours. They literally explode their goodness with each bite, making it necessary for you to reach out for a napkin or two to dab your mouth with after each bite. \n \nNon-yakitori items are also available at Sumire. The Japanese Daisen Chicken Hotpot is made from Daisen chicken, a breed of chicken that has been raised on the Daisen mountain in Tottori Prefecture (north of Kyoto) in Japan. The stock itself is chock-full of goodness, with chicken meat, minced chicken balls, prawn, fried tofu, enoki mushrooms, okra, zucchini, and fungus all contributing to its robust and hearty flavour.\n \nLove runny eggs? The D-I-Y Tamago Toji Hotplate is the perfect dish for you. Tossed in the hotplate are grilled chicken meat, grilled chicken meatballs, and mixed mushrooms, all mixed in a savoury-sweet dashi. Unlike the usual Tamago Toji dishes, Sumire serves the raw pasteurized egg separately so you can decide how cooked you want your egg to be. Do not ignore the accompanying rice bowl topped with Egg Tempura. The yolk itself is comfortingly runny, and together with the chicken pieces hidden in the rice, it is an eggy party in the mouth. For a yakitori night out that is far from yucky, Sumire is the place for you.

It’s an intimate space but even then the kitchen is an open-concept one, so you can see the chefs hard at work turning out your roast chooks and other delights in a manner not unlike watching your grandma potter away in the kitchen. You’ll want to make a booking because this tiny hole in the wall has only one indoor table with a small alfresco section, and even then these chefs have a cult following who’ll gamely brave muggy weather for some French perfection.\n\nYou’ll know once you walk in what the specialty is: that warm thyme and butter scent, and the familiar fragrance of perfectly crisp, browned skin can only mean exquisite French-style roast chicken. A hormone and antibiotic free bird is given a good roast after being slathered with creamy, herb-scented butter for extra crispiness and flavour. It comes accompanied with roasted sprouts and spuds, plus a gravy-boat of jus, liquid gold that elevates this to high gourmand territory. Besides chicken, think other French bistro classics like a formidable, Gruyère encrusted Croque Monsieur, other roasted meats like a beautiful Sage & Mustard Roasted Kurobuta Pork Collar, and the king of all grilled joints, the Premium Roast Prime Rib Steak, a family-sized cut of Angus beef. It’s not the biggest menu, but that just means they give a lot more love and attention to each plate, which, if you ask us, is perfect.

There are perfectly churned classics like Sea Salt Gula Melaka and Dark Chocolate Ferrero, but why not live a little and give less ubiquitous flavours like Earl Grey Lavender or their seasonal flavours a try.

The name symbolised a fresh start with immense possibilities and was the inspiration of our longtime and dear friend, highly acclaimed Chef Masakazu Ishibashi, affectionately known as “Chef Masa” by his followers in Japan and Asia.\r\n\r\nToday, we are extremely privileged and humbled to announce a new chapter and the continuation of our dream with the official rebrand to Sushi Ayumu by Masa Ishibashi.\r\n\r\nThis will be Chef Masa’s second outpost outside of Tokyo, following his successful “Sushi Nanami by Masa Ishibashi” in Taipei.\r\n\r\nChef Masa comes from a family which ran a sushi restaurant in Tochigi prefecture and spent a lot of time behind the counter growing up. Many of his followers would have known him as the Executive Chef for Ginza Sushi Ichi Tokyo, Jakarta, Bangkok and Singapore. He led its Singapore branch to Michelin 1-star before starting Shoukouwa where he led them as the first “sushiya” in Singapore to earn Michelin 2-stars in their first 2 years of business. In Nov 2017, he returned to Tokyo with his wife Tomomi to establish Sushi Masa Ishibashi at Ginza, where he has become the latest culinary sensation at the heart of Tokyo’s high end dining scene.\r\n\r\nKnown for his precision and finesse, Chef Masa will impart his eye for details and dynamism with us through this rebrand. Together, we will start walking towards a new dream to reflect his vision and interpretation of the perfect sushi “omakase” indulgence, along with our renowned “omotenashi” in a calm and luxurious intimate setting. We welcome you to embark on a memorable and decadent dining journey with us at “Sushi Ayumu by Masa Ishibashi”. Looking forward to the pleasure of your next visit very soon.\r\n\r\nYoroshiku Onegaishimasu.

At Sushi Kou, the best oceanic catch and seasonal vegetables are flown in twice a week from the restaurant's suppliers in Tokyo, Kyoto, and Hokkaido. The chefs then plan omakase menus around the bounty of fresh ingredients. Hence, each omakase experience is uniquely different. \r\n\r\nOpt for the seven-course menu if you want a quick introduction to omakase-style dining, with appetizers, sashimi platters, grilled items, and sushi.\r\n\r\nTamago Tofu with Tobiko is a steamed egg dish topped with flying fish roe for that extra burst of flavor. A great way to start the meal, this appetizer is light yet flavourful. A signature at Sushi Kou is the Unagi Nasu Tempura, with lightly fried unagi that’s rolled in eggplant. \r\n\r\nEnd your meal with the Gai Inaniwa Udon, topped with scallops, shrimps, and pumpkins. Featuring thinly sliced noodles that are braised before they are set to cool, the noodles are smooth and extremely tasty.

With that said, a meal at Sushi Mieda is nothing short of breathtaking. Though what's served will change depending on what's in season in Japan at the current moment, you can be rest assured that everything will be prepared with craft and precision, earning Sushi Mieda a place among the upper crust of the best sushi restaurants in Singapore.\nFor our meal, we were welcomed with a starter of sea urchin atop sesame tofu, covered in a bonito-broth jelly, and garnished with a touch of caviar and gold leaf. Describing the combination of flavours and textures as a symphony probably doesn't do it justice; the balance of saltiness from the bonito jelly and sweetness from the sea urchin and sesame tofu meant it was more a masterpiece than any 'mere' composition.\nCourse after course convinced us that we were dining in the presence of a master craftsman. Head Chef Keisuke Ohno treated us to a dazzling array of fish both expected and uncommon. For the less sushi-seasoned, opportunities to sample fishes like golden-eyed snapper and black-throat perch will open your mind to an ocean far beyond salmon, tuna, and flounder.\nThe setting for this culinary master class is equally authentic. Seats at the sushi counter of eight make for an intimate dining experience, its position at the centre of the floor just emphasizing the exclusivity, while sitting at the \"outside\" tables lining the interior of the tower provide for spectacular views of the surrounding area.\nQuite frankly, any meal at Sushi Mieda lets you leave the trappings of Collyer Quay far behind. An effortlessly bona fide Japanese experience, don't be surprised if you stumble back out, sated and blissful, and find yourself disorientated by the realization that you aren't standing on a street in Ginza.

Night owls swear by their Mee Suah Kueh, Prawn and Banana Fritters, and the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun. First two items are fairly unique, items that draw in the diners from all over Singapore, and the last, simply a really good rendition of an increasingly common dim sum item that almost every Singaporean loves.\nThe space is humble, the food is simple, but Swee Choon Tim Sum is timeless in its appeal.

Located in the luxe Crockfords Tower of Resorts World Sentosa, this spot pays homage to Japanese fine dining with their refreshing interpretations of classics. A sleek interior boasts natural accents like wood and marble and makes the perfect spot for a business lunch to impress, or even a date night to impress.\r\n\r\nFor a dish that is as delicious as it is Instagram-worthy, try the Sea Urchin Rolled by Wagyu Beef. Served on little gold spoons, the delight is made with the beloved Japanese uni rolled up in a thin strip of raw beef. Elegant and simple, it is the perfect way to prime your palate for the flavours to come. The Wagyu Beef Sukiyaki is a premium plate that is a must-try for meat lovers. Made with thin strips of premium meat cooked at the table, the beef absorbs the flavours of the broth and is so tender, it falls off the fork. Kurobuta Pork and Wagyu Beef Shabu-Shabu are also available for diners to enjoy at their tables.

TEN means “heaven” or “celebration” in Japanese and in the case of TEN Sushi, this can’t be more true: the cosy enclave is little more than a year old but has made its own splash with Sushi Master Marusaya at its helm. So whether you are looking for a mouthwatering array of fresh fish air-flown from Japan, impeccable hand-rolls, or just a comfy bowl of Don, TEN Sushi has got you more than covered. \nThe Salmon Tartar provides an enticing sneak peek into the exhilarating epicurean journey ahead. A generous portion of salmon cubes is masterfully drizzled with a tangy spicy sauce that does not mask the salmon’s delightful creaminess, while the runny goodness of a perfectly poached onsen egg elevates the entire appetizer. Jumping right into mains, the sushi steals the show with its sheer freshness. Don’t believe us? Try the delicate 3 Kinds of Blue Fin Tuna Sushi for yourself. The rolls don’t disappoint either - the Fisherman Inside-Out-Roll, for instance, features 10 types of fresh fish, totally changing the game for your usual hand roll. \nAnother highlight: the wide selection of sake, whiskey, and beers imported from Japan, so be sure to ask your friendly staff to recommend the perfect accomplice to a great meal!

His eponymous Kyoto restaurant was awarded One Michelin Star, and he is one of the most revered Japanese chefs in the world.

The richness of the mushroom and the tenderness of the beef make for a hearty combination. Crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, these little bites are the perfect for whetting your appetite. There are a range of meaty mains here - the Wagyu Hamburg Steak is cooked on the teppan grill and has a signature smoky flavour that seeps into the meat and gives it a unique flavour.

The basic elements are almost religious in their simplicity: beautifully marbled and fresh meat, a smoky fire, and some subtle dipping sauces to go along. Oh, and bowlfuls of steaming hot rice on which to baste those hot, meaty drippings. \n\nHere at Tajimaya, the menu is basically page after page of different grades of top-grade meat, though really they are most famous for their offerings of divine Miyazaki Beef offered in a range of cuts from ribeye to chuck short rib. Choose from an à la carte menu or simply get the set, which comes with a generous lineup of sides from crunchy Tempura to a daily selection of Sashimi, as well as a comforting bowl of Garlic Fried Rice. Apart from Miyazaki beef, there is US Wagyu and US Angus, as well as fatty Kurobuta Pork for lovers of that other great barbecue meat. The pork is available in a range of cuts as well, including the unctuous jowl cut, or meltingly tender cheek that will reduce to a fatty sliver of joy in your mouth. \n\nTo undercut all of that meaty goodness, other dishes here include Korean-inspired soups like Kimchi Soup and hot-stone Ishiyaki Dons filled with meat and vegetables crackling from the heat of the bowl. To fill up, slurp up some piping hot Udon. With meat this good, you’ll want very little else but rice, but these other options make this restaurant perfect for hitting every corner of that Japanese craving you’ve been nursing.

The space is all sexy dim lighting, cheeky neon-lit signs, and little Thai accents in the decor. Think gritty Bangkok streets and lux Singapore nightlife; you’d be forgiven for thinking it’s a newfangled cocktail bar!\nThe food is modern Thai and draws from different Thai regional cuisines, giving them fun and glamorous make-overs. Seafood takes pride of place here, with a mix of traditional and modern touches. If you like oysters, here they come topped with Asian-inspired granita or served with fiery Thai chili jam. Tender Norwegian salmon is served like you’ve never had it before: dressed in sweet and sour Nam Jin Sauce. That old hawker centre classic, grilled stingray, comes to the table with lashings of tamarind relish. Not to be outdone, French lobster bisque gets the hot and tangy tom yum treatment. It’s not just seafood. Pork and chicken dishes get similar Thai makeovers, and there’s plenty of classics like Phad Thai and various Thai curries to sate your Thai craving.

At Tamashii along North Canal Road, that’s precisely what you get. An elegant blend of tradition and panache, food is served on wooden oars in homage to Japanese fishermen who did the same once upon a time.\r\nThe freshest ingredients are flown in regularly from Japan, and Chef Patrick Tan continuously goes out of his way to prepare the amazing produce in tantalising, and occasionally fascinating ways! Previous seasonal stunners include grilled squid lips, ivory shell sashmi (called Shiro Baigai in Japanese), and Japanese clams served in a variety of ways.\r\nYou can’t go to a Japanese robataya without having some grilled fish though, and the seasonal Barracuda was grilled to perfection. The skin of the fish was crispy, the flesh moist and tender. It tasted of the grill and the sea, and felt like a portal to being seated on the beach, charcoal in the sand, and fish straight from the ocean.\r\nWe love the idea of walking into your favourite restaurant and eagerly asking “what’s in season right now?” Whether it’s the fruit of the land or the fruits of the ocean, there’s definitely only the freshest ‘fruit’ on offer at Tamashii, and we’re always eager to be introduced to something new, delicious, and satisfying whenever we visit.

Each dish in the gourmet menu is carefully handcrafted by a team of talented chefs using classic recipes and time honoured methods which date back in time across India’s rich history. Ever conscious of our diners’ palettes, some dishes use healthier preparation methods while retaining their original Indian heritage.\r\n\r\nContemporary yet laced with tradition, Tandoor’s interior is dotted with subtle Indian motifs.

There are no fixed combinations here; instead, diners put together their own bowl from an array of fresh ingredients. \r\n\r\nThe Creamy Fusilli is a good base to build your bowl around. The curly pasta is cooked al dente and bathed in a rich, aromatic sauce laced with garlic and onion. For mains to go with the pasta, try the Salmon — the fish is grilled til’ fork-tender, with a crisp skin. Also good is the Roasted Chicken Thigh, with a lightly-peppered skin and succulent juicy meat. \r\n\r\nDinner is a good time to head over with friends, you can sit back and share nibbles in a leisurely fashion. Be sure to try the Cajun Mushrooms, an addictive snack of plump button mushrooms encased in a golden-brown battered skin.

Based in Changi Village, this storied culinary establishment that was formerly based on Pulau Tekong has been wowing diners with its consistently fresh seafood and Chinese cuisine for over thirty-five years and counting.\nHere, freshness is practically guaranteed as the restaurant tends to use live seafood that has been recently caught by local fishermen off the Singapore coast. And there’s something for everyone. For the health-conscious eaters, the Nyonya Steamed Fish is a great catch – bursting with flavour without the use of any oil. Meanwhile, the Ginger and Spring Onion Lobster is cleverly done, with the bright notes from ginger enhancing the tender lobster flesh. Vegetarians don’t have to despair, as the restaurant has plenty of stellar options to pick from, whether it is the soft Thai Style Tofu, or the crunchy Fried French Beans. And of course, one must not pass on the classic tze char go-to, the fluffy and fragrant Oyster Omelette.\nOn weekends, you’ll see this eating joint packed to its gills with families large and small. And thanks to its coastal views, dining at Tekong Seafood Restaurant feels like a respite from the usual city life. Now don’t wait, chope a reservation for your next meal there!

Enter the abalone, one of the signature ingredients at this restaurant, and some say done to perfection here. Served braised with sea cucumber, it may not taste like much, but it’s days in the making, and when eaten, is pillowy, soft, and bursting with briny goodness. There’s also Teochew-style duck, braised and served sliced on a platter with stewed pork belly, marinated eggs, tofu, and a lashing of sweet, herbal gravy. Steamed Pomfret, a Teochew hallmark, and one of the restaurant’s signatures, arrives shiny and pearlescent on the table, strewn with fine aromatic garnishes, and a light poaching liquor. The meat gives way in firm but perfectly tender chunks. For truly festive occasions, a whole, glistening, crisp-skinned suckling pig is available, too, and the meal is best rounded off with some signature Yam Paste, cooked with lard to perfection and topped with stewed pumpkin and gingko nuts.\n A mix of humble fare prepared to perfection, and premium ingredients prepared with masterful simplicity: Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee is a heritage restaurant, of the best in Asia, and available at your doorstep.

The pancake here is stuffed with juicy slices of pork belly and beef tendon, mixed with potato and a fried egg for an indulgent treat.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, order a slab of the Wagyu Ribeye for sharing — the beef is cooked simply over the grill, then served with a dash of salt and pepper to bring out the rich, buttery flavours of the cut. For dessert, save space for the restaurant’s signature Warabi Mochi. Made with fine kinako (roasted soy bean) powder and black sugar syrup, these fluffy little pillows are the perfect sweet treat to end a delicious meal.

And with drinks from an award-winning mixologist, matched with trendy fare from a culinary heavy-hitter, it's easy to obsess over Tess.\nLike any it-girl, or it-restaurant for that matter, Tess has a distinctive style, swagger and can back it all up with bona fide coolness. That confidence comes from tatted-up head chef Martin Wong, with L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon kitchen cred and whose expertise in fine dining and playful personality comes through in a variety of small, medium and large plates, which vary in fanciness, but all aim to satisfy.\nBehind the bar, you can find the shaken-up creations of Steve Leong, the well-known finalist of Diageo Reserve World Class' Singapore 2013. That means that the cocktails are as fine as the dining at Tess, whether you go with old world classics or newfangled tipples. He's not alone in dreaming up drinks, however, as Tess plays host to the city's up and comers in the bar scene, in what turns out to be an open mic night of sorts, that the regular patrons, and there are a lot of them, love.\nSettle into the hip, glowy space that's configured for optimal hanging out. From the menu, the Duet Scallop & Aburi Tartare shows off Tess' fancier side, with scorched meaty scallops played against a refreshing chopped tartare. Also from the small plates, the Crispy Pork Belly is simplistic in its flavour, served with a fusion dip, forming a savoury, finger-licking good dish. From the Medium Plates, the Tess Wagyu Cubes & Bone Marrow is a surefire winner, with pan seared cuts of beef glazed with veal jus and marrow, just in case you needed more of a meat hit.\nIt's not all about the carnivores, though, as a selection of cheeses and even Vegan mains (a rare sight at Singapore fine dining restaurants, let alone a bar) can satisfy meatless diners. From that section, the Bohemian Vegetables Love is a colourful tangle of grilled zucchini, capsicum, aubergine and a piquant red pepper coulis. Finally, from the limited selection of dessert, the Chocolate Fondant with Blueberry Compote shows that the kitchen keeps careful measure of foodie trends, with savoury elements of spicy apple crumble accenting the luscious classic cake.\nIn the end, it's not just the good looks and impressive resume at Tess that will have you coming back for more, but the rotating food and drinks menu of creative selections. In fact, you are sure to learn what other fans already know: when it comes to Tess, just say yes.

Featuring artisan Bourbon flights and stick-to-your-ribs soul food, it's sure to tame your beast of an appetite.\n\nWrapped around a corner of Jalan Klapa, The Beast is a pint-sized space with gallons of flavour. Kick-started by local entrepreneur Jamie Koh of The Chupitos Bar fame, the barn-like eatery is an ode to her college days in Atlanta, Georgia. And some fun times those must have been, judging by the heavy influence of Kentucky-sourced bourbon whisky, including their signature and self-explanatory Baconator shot. The narrow ground floor area is raw and rustic, save for a trendy marquee sign along the inner wall. You could also opt for a roomier dining area upstairs, or for an alfresco barrel-topped table along the walking path.\n\nWhile it's a space built for fun times and honky-tonk, the food takes its tradition of Southern hospitality very seriously. You'd be hard-pressed to find such true-blue Southern specialties as fluffy buttermilk biscuits with sausage gravy and Cajun-spiced shrimp and grits anywhere else in the city, let alone such superb versions. Though the reputation for Southern fare starts with fried chicken and ends with extra butter (Paula Deen-style), The Beast features a complete array of the diverse flavours for which the region is so popular for. If you haven't tried these dishes before, consider this your warning that this stuff is habit-forming, and though not diet-friendly, definitely worth the splurge.\n\nGo for their new brunch menu, when those fresh-from-the-oven biscuits are on display, stuffed with drool-worthy fillings like crispy battered chicken and slow cooked pulled pork. Also noteworthy are the classic Chicken & Waffles, the Mac & Cheese Burger and savoury Cornbread. Washed down with icy Sweet Tea, or all you can drink Mimosas at $30, that's some really good eatin' y'all!

How else to describe the dizzyingly gorgeous lobby, fluttering with hushed, 5-star service? You’d never know this spot once harboured one of the city’s original bustling ports of call for maritime trade. Since 1933, ships would be warmly greeted with savoury local specialties dished out by floating hawkers. Honouring that charming bit of history, The Clifford Pier acts as a showstopping backdrop for all-day Southeast Asian nibbles.It’s hard to imagine the glittery shores of Marina Bay hosting anything other than the sleek luxuries it's known for, The Fullerton Bay Hotel being its crown jewel. As such, it’s a lovely thought that The Clifford Pier pays respects to the rich tradition of the Bay’s enterprising currents, showcasing the best that Old Singapore has to offer then and now. And The Clifford Pier isn’t paying tribute with just a local-tinted menu, but rather a fully educated selection including rich Laksa, Soup Kambing, The Pier's Lobster Roll, Heritage Bites and Wagyu Rendang.However the homey cuisine doesn’t collide with the frothy aesthetic of the cavernous dining room. As if plucked from the set of a Baz Luhrmann film, the lushly appointed space is swathed in nautical hues of mineral blues, sandy buffs and rich textures. Under ivory arches with a view of the bay, the familiar cuisine at The Clifford Pier is just the opulence you’d expect from The Fullerton Bay Hotel.

The Spicy Prawn And Scallop Aglio Olio is tossed in a fiery, umami-packed oil, with plump crustaceans served with their heads on so you can suck out all the rich juices. There’s also a creamy Carbonara loaded with generous slivers of fried bacon, and Salmon with Spicy Mentaiko donburi garnished with gleaming ikura pearls. For heartier mains, order the Duck Confit.

The hostess then gestures you toward the beer fridge as if to offer you a drink. But instead of pulling out a tasty cold brew, the fridge door opens up into a portal into another realm like something out of a real-life Alice in Wonderland. “This is where you must continue alone,” says the hostess, as the fridge door opens into a street alley that transports you into the braised underbelly of the “Long Tang” that is The Dragon Chamber. Things are not always as they appear.\r\nSecretly located within a brightly coloured Kopitiam, The Dragon Chamber is a hidden restaurant. What may look like a regular beer fridge in a kopitiam is actually a secret door that opens up into its own inner recesses. Reminiscent of Chinatown gambling dens and secret society hangouts, the walls of The Dragon Chamber are covered with artwork from local and regional artists such as Sabotage, Mister Tucks, and Riandy Karuniawan, referencing past and recent Chinese tradition from a globalist, counter-culture point of view.\r\nThe Dragon Chamber offers an unconventional menu serving “guerilla style” food, representing dishes that are not typical banquet style Chinese food. Among its own wild concoctions from The Dragon Chamber’s test kitchen, the underground restaurant also brings back age-old Chinese dishes that never caught on in mainstream restaurants, because of unconventional ingredients. Yet the flavours are immense. Contrasting lovable Chinese-American recipes, The Dragon Chamber pushes the diner’s comfort zone with adventurous dishes that may even shock diners with unusual Chinese techniques of nose-to-tail animal preparation. One such dish is the Dragon’s Claw. Touted as one of the restaurant’s signature dishes, it features a Crocodile Foot braised in Chinese herbs, served on a bed of greens and a literal ring of fire. Bearing a taste similarly close to chicken, the meat is tender and sweet. Its skin is painstakingly descaled with a torch, revealing a thick and rich layer of collagen that coats the succulent herb-marinated meat with a soft and sticky texture, adding a consistent mouthfeel to every bite. If crocodile foot and mammal innards might be too adventurous for some, we also offer more conventional favourites such as Firecracker Chicken and Wagyu Truffle Hor Fun.\r\nNot a space for political correctness and mellow elevator music, the restaurant recommends not bringing any overtly conservative in-laws you might have. Make your way down to The Dragon Chamber, we dare you to enter the bowels of Chinese cuisine to discover your true gastronomic self.

Helmed by Head Bartender and Co-Owner Yugnes Susela, The Elephant Room is located in a cosy yet visually striking second floor space of a shophouse on the fringes of Keong Saik Road. \r\n\r\nThe bar is marking their eventful first year with a new menu of tipples and nibbles.

Lush green foliage at the entrance gives way to dimly-lit interiors decked with Terry O’Neill photographs, while jazz music plays softly in the background. \r\n \r\nFrom the menu comes British classics like fish and chips and beef wellington. The former is no greasy battered fish served in a newspaper cone; instead, White brings in top-grade English turbot, lightly-battered and served with thick, golden chips cooked in beef fat. Order mains like the Grilled Rib of Black Angus Beef and the Honey Roast Belly Pork Marco Polo to share. The Honey Roast Pork Belly comes piping hot in a claypot, where four generous slabs of unctuous meat lie on a bed of fried kway teow. The smoky rice noodles, together with the marbled meat and crunchy pieces of crackling are a wonderful combination that will keep you coming back for more. \r\n\r\nSave some space for desserts — portions are dainty enough to have one all by yourself.

Located in the swish Duo Galleria, this spot has made a name for itself as one of the few places in the city that offer a modern drinking experience with a nod to our roots. With an exposed brick interior, sleek lighting, and a posh feel, this spot wouldn’t look out of place on the streets of Melbourne.\r\n\r\nThe seafood and poultry dishes are popular choices, and for good reason! Both dishes offer a hefty portion of meat without an exorbitant price tag. There are even gluten-free and plant-based options for diners who have dietary restrictions. The Mushroom Pizza is great for sharing. The crust is made in-house, and makes for a light base that doesn’t overpower the earthy mushroom toppings.\r\n\r\nCome here for a tipple or two, or dance the night away to some downtempo funk. Whether you’re in the mood for wine or whisky, a Singapore Sling or a Mojito, the staff will be happy to make recommendations.","PRESS RELEASE":"","images":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/07/s-725x360x80xo_1594184324_25736.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_hokki_1571214770.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_Exter_1571214770.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_cake__1571214770.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_meat__1571214771.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_Inter_1571214770.jpg?date=202106080907","https://static.chope.co/uploads/2019/10/s-725x360x80xo_SG_The_Gong_by_Drinks_Co_pizza_1571214771.jpg?date=202106080907"]},{"title":"The Grand Lobby (Raffles Hotel)","Cuisine":"British","Menus":["https://static.chope.co/uploads/2020/07/1595411234_16251.pdf"],"Hours":"BreakfastMon-Sun: 7-10:30amAfternoon TeaMon-Thu: 1-5pmFri-Sun: 12-6pmHeritage MenuMon-Sun: 6:30-9pm","Price":"$$$$","Good For":"Business Meetings, Casual Dining, Quiet Dinner, Romantic Dates","Location":"City Hall","Address":"1 Beach RoadRaffles SingaporeSingapore (189673)                                                Map","Address Link":"https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=1.295168,103.8536569&query_place_id=ChIJtaZzuqUZ2jERP01wPHzyWoE","DISHES WE LOVE":"Scones with Clotted Cream and Rose Petal Jam, Rouge Opera Tea, Vert Provence Tea","ABOUT":"Indulge in a timeless experience in the restored Grand Lobby of the iconic Raffles Singapore.

And no, we’re not talking about ice cream here. The Gyu Bar brings in one of the rarest wagyu in town — Wa-OH beef from the Kumamoto prefecture on Kyushu Island. If you’re wondering why this matters, imagine this: the super fresh air and pure, pristine waters make the perfect environment for grazing cows. The meat here is also extra-tender, thanks to a special blend of feed given to the animals. At Gyu Bar, you’ll find some surprising cuts as well as the usual ribeye and sirloin fillets. Try the tomo-sankaku (a cut near the bottom round). A considerably rare cut, the glistening meat is juicy and buttery, served with a crusty sear. A little dab of wasabi helps balance out the fattiness of the meat. There’s also shin-tama, which comes from the knuckle, as well as leaner cuts like short plate. Besides beef, Gyu Bar also offers other meats like pork neck or tontoro.

While this is a reference to the world-famous Ginger Garden of the Singapore Botanic Gardens where the restaurant is located, the word itself has long been synonymous with comfort for many -- ginger tea, ginger massages. And if comfort is what you are looking for after a hard day at work or a long afternoon of relentless shopping, The Halia is the ideal place for you to kick back and relax in style.\nIn the historic UNESCO World Heritage Site that is the Singapore Botanic Gardens, The Halia is an inviting space with lush foliage complemented by wood-carved tables and open verandas. This matches the menu well, as modern European cuisine with touches of Asian influences are on offer. Favourites include the Halia Chilli Crab Spaghettini and the Sticky Toffee Pudding with Butterscotch and Vanilla Ice Cream, so be sure to try them. The piquant flavours of the former ensure that you get a taste of one of Singapore’s most beloved dishes, while keeping your hands clean, and the latter is a throwback to a more decadent colonial past.\nIn keeping with the name, ginger is very much on the menu, with the irreplaceable underground root used in main courses, salads and drinks. The health benefits of ginger are multifold, from relieving digestive problems such as nausea to aiding the loss of appetite, motion sickness, and pain. It certainly is comforting to have all these great upsides in mind as you sip a ginger-infused cocktail, take in the luxuriant foliage, and relax in The Halia.

Some of the well-loved dishes (and deservedly so!) include the Warm Seafood Salad where scallops, shrimp, squid, and crab meat are served alongside warm garlic bread. The Sausage Sampler is sure to become your next favourite thing, with an expansive variety of meats that include chicken mushroom sausage, pork chorizo, veal bratwurst, among others.  \n \nFeaturing an intoxicating blend of cold brews, good nosh, and a lively crowd, The Hideout at District 20 is one of our favourite Marymount-based hangouts that injects a dose of much-needed fun into the neighbourhood.

The chef’s insistence to use only grain-fed, chilled baby lamb from Australia or New Zealand means you don’t get the gamey smell so often associated with this meat. Instead, the grilled lamb chops are juicy and tender, with a clean, milky taste. \r\n\r\nTry the specialty Jingisukan With Lamb Chop set, which comes with different cuts such as the fillet, loin, and chops. Grilled together with plump mushrooms and fresh vegetables for an added crunch, the set can be considered a delicious and satisfying meal on its own. If you’re still feeling a tad peckish, add on some cheese miso and lotus root chips for nibbles.

A warm, smoothly finished wood bar, Shoji-inspired light fixtures that dominate the ceiling, and eclectic touches like the bright colour displays, evoke images of autumn and summer. Lit brightly enough for you to appreciate the details, but still seductively dark enough to leave plenty to the imagination, The Horse's Mouth is ahead of the pack when it comes to setting the scene for a great night out.\nIf you're a hungry horse, then don't fret. The snack menu is feedbag full of tasty, with the nonkotsu (chicken softbone), tatami iwashi (dried sardine crackers), and eihire (stingray fins) the ideal bar food to take the edge off. Feeling like you could eat a horse? We don't recommend that, but you'll be happy to know that you can order from Uma Uma's selection of umami ramen for something more robust.\nAs for the thirsty ones, well, the menu looked all well and delicious, but when a joint tells you it's a cocktail bar, then we believe that drinks have to be bespoke. You might have some trouble remembering what exactly was in them after all is said and done, but that's the price you pay for delectable cocktails that run the gamut of sweet, sour, fruity, or just straight up strong. Let them know what you want, and there'll be no horsing around.\nIf you're wondering why, or how, a place can be this slick (or why we made so many bad puns), our advice is not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Round up your drinking buddies, saddle up, and ride on down to The Horse's Mouth. We know a champion when we see one.

Kick off your buffet spread with some hot Soup Kambing, a spicy broth of mutton bones, or a piquant Harissa Soup from the Middle East. Then move along to hearty regional mains like Beef Stew, savoury Malaysian Fried Fish with Kerabu Mangga (shredded mango), or Indian Mutton. That’s just the tip of the iceberg at this spread, which also includes Indian classics like Chicken Masala and Thai dishes like Minced Chicken with Thai Basil. For a more conventional continental buffet experience, there are live carving stations for beef and lamb, as well as a chilled seafood selection where you can grab fresh prawns and Spanish mussels.

Inside its dim, sexy interiors, tuck into British style pub-grub like a hearty braised Lamb Shank served on a pillowy mound of mash, a classic Bangers & Mash doused in homemade black pepper sauce, or a flaky Fish & Chips served with tangy tartar sauce and fat-cut chips. Beyond pub grub, there’s also slightly fancier fare like a crisp Duck Confit on pomme puree and garden salad, or a simple Grilled Salmon Fillet on a bed of sauteed greens, as well as pastas like a rich Pesto Pasta and a homey Parmesan-rich Beef Bolognese.

We especially love Dario's twists on classics like the smoke-infused Old Cuban, made with rum and citrus, or the bizarre Reverse Gin and Tonic, a mix of gin and tonic syrup that's carbonated at freezing temperatures at the table, ensuring a crisp, if a little science-fiction like, drink. On top of this, ask for any classic you can name, which Dario and his team will fix for you with pleasure.The main appeal for us, though, is Dario's pet project: he takes bottled spirits and finishes them in specially-treated casks to infuse them with new flavour dimensions. Your favourite whisky or rum can be turned into a completely different drink given some extra time in a sherry cask, or a gin you thought you knew and loved is given a new depth of flavour through infusions with all manner of fruit peel, herbs, and spices.

Now, our favourite chain is taking it up a notch with their new outfit, The Ranch Steakhouse. The classic steakhouse sits along Clarke Quay with al fresco seating, so you get a great view to go with your meats.\n\nThe Ranch focuses on great beef here. Start with the Beef Tartare, hand-chopped tenderloin with plenty of delicious spices, and laced with a generous dash of XO cognac. Pan-fried Foie Gras is great if you’re looking to indulge — the fatty goose liver comes with an oozy soft-boiled egg, dried apricots and raspberries, and a warm, umami-packed bacon dressing.\n\nOf course, meat is the star of the show at The Ranch. The New Zealand Grass-Fed Black Angus Sirloin is juicy and tender, and priced at great value. If you love the funky flavours that come with dry-ageing beef, try the USDA Prime 30 Days Dry-Aged Bone-In Ribeye. The cut is served bone-in, and the steak has a delicious buttery sear. You also get tableside service when you order this cut, so sit back and feel like a VIP.\nTo go with your meats, order from an extensive range of wines or get a pint of German beer from the bar.

He also earned the opportunity of hosting and working with numerous Michelin-starred veterans such as Massimiliano Alajmo of the three-starred Le Calandre in Padua, Italy; Guy Martin of the three-starred Le Grand Véfour in Paris, France; and Esben Holmboe Bang of the three-starred Maaemo in Oslo, Norway.\r\n\r\nThe food at The Spot is highly individualistic – with the starting point an ingredient that excites Chef Lee with the drive to introduce its beauty to the world by elevating its flavors.

Amidst the hilly greenery of the surrounding landscape, there's a high chance that you'll forget you're in Singapore, though the food and drinks here, created by a team led by Chef Chris Millar, will remind you that you're in one of the world's great dining cities.\nCrafted in partnership with farming communities in Singapore and farther afield, and topped off with produce from an on-site organic garden, this is a gourmet restaurant with a heart for nature.

Thus Coffee is one of them, a specialty coffee joint in a charming residential area along Jalan Kuras, just a couple of minutes away from the Lower Peirce Reservoir Park. The space isn’t massive, but it’s very chic, done up with handsome wooden touches and a brushed concrete floor that announces its serious-coffee intentions. They’ve got an in-house roast and blend that they use for their coffees which promises a robust pick-me-up, but beyond a cuppa the food here is also to die for. Think subtle variations on the all-day breakfast menu, including treats like their in-house breakfast plate that features sous vide eggs on a fluffy muffin, paired with apple cider sausage, back bacon, mushrooms, and baked beans. Or the Salmon & Kale Toast, a fluffy brioche toastie topped with smoked salmon and avocado, creamy eggs, and a spinach and feta salad.\n\nLunch plates here take a heartier turn, with numbers like the Korean-inspired Chicken Cutlet Jyolmeon, chewy Gochujang-drenched noodles topped with a crispy chicken cutlet and sunny side up egg. The pasta here isn’t your garden variety stuff either, with punchy plates like the Linguine Puttanesca, bursting with ripe olives, piquant capers, chunky tomatoes, and briny anchovies. No self-respecting millennial outfit is complete with a grain bowl, and here the Wagyu Beef Grain Bowl takes pride of place, featuring tender beef atop a mélange of pearl barley and quinoa for some good artery-clearing health benefits and lots of toothsome flavour. Come for the mid-day coffee but stay for the mid-day snack and maybe dinner at this charming, Instagram-worthy haunt in one of Singapore’s most idyllic little neighbourhoods.

Made with a generous serving of salmon tossed in kale with chilli and garlic, this dish is simple, spicy, and delicious.\n\nFor something a little heartier, opt for the Chorizo & Kale Broth.

Founded by four friends with varying expertise, this restaurant specialises in authentic Thai cuisine and is modelled after the communal dining restaurants of Thailand. The first overseas outpost of this popular Thai restaurant specialises in Thai classics, and also brings us a variety of new dishes that are equally as tempting.\n\nThe Issan Spicy Grilled Pork Neck Fried Rice is one of the popular menu items, and features buttery rice stir-fried in a mix of spices and topped with tender pork neck meat. The richness of the pork meat combined with the fragrant rice makes for a filling meal. Another unique menu item is  the Minced Pork Dip In Preserved Soy Bean And Coconut Milk Served With Rice Crackers. The tender pork and coconut together is a deliciously sweet combination, and is tempered by the briny flavour of preserved soybean. \n\nFor something a little lighter, opt for the Steamed Whole Sea Bass In Spicy Lime Sauce. The tangy and spicy sauce combined with the tenderness of the steamed fish is irresistable. Enjoy this dish with a bowl of steamed rice, or dig into it on its own.

With 20 outlets in Japan, this is the first overseas outpost of the beloved unagi franchise. Famed for their expert grilling techniques and secret in-house sauces, this unagi restaurant is a must-visit for diners who love fine Japanese dining.\n\nThe Unagi here is served in three different styles, namely: Hitsumabushi - where the eel is placed over a bed of rice and served with three condiments, Seiro Mushi, which is served with Hokkaido rice, egg, and a sweet sauce, and Mamushi Donburi, which is served with Japanese yam, mentaiko, kinshi eggs and onsen egg. The latter two dishes are unique to the Singaporean incarnation of the restaurant, while the former is a signature dish available at all outlets. The unagi for all three dishes is marinated in a spice mixture made with ingredients directly imported from Tokyo before being steamed, then subsequently grilled - just as they do at all outlets across Japan.\n\nWhether you’re an unagi connoisseur or just a fan of seafood, the wallet-friendly prices, intimate dining environment, and exquisite dishes here will surely entice you to visit more than once!

For added indulgence, the Uni Oyster Shot combines uni with a freshly shucked oyster in a single, oceany mouthful.To make your uni go a little further, have it as one of a selection of sashimi atop a bowl of rice in the restaurant's hefty Bara Chirashi. But perhaps the most classic and delicious way to serve it up is in the hearty Ikura Uni Chirashi, which features mounds of salty salmon roe and uni atop rice, just mouthful after mouthful of pure, umami magic.

Exposed brick walls, sakura woods, and simple fabric chairs give the space a warm vibe but doesn’t overwhelm – an excellent way to let the wagyu-centric dishes shine.Ushidoki’s kaiseki dinners are prepared by Chef Hirohashi Nobuaki, and you can choose different types of omakase sets. You’ll probably skip the 12-course menu if you’re not famished, but a wagyu beef lover would well be tempted to give it a shot. There’s wagyu salad, a luxuriously prepared wagyu sukiyaki, and 3-kind wagyu sashimi moriawase where chef picks include wagyu wrapped around uni (sea urchin) and oyster topped with wagyu. The meat is Ozaki wagyu beef – a big deal since there’s only one farm in Japan that sells wagyu under this name – and finding a restaurant serving the same Ozaki beef is incredibly rare.If you’re looking for quality dishes that revolve around premium beef and done in Japanese style, book early for Ushidoki – especially since they claim to serve the whole cow in one course.

What it does best is the exquisite, perfectly grilled traditional unagi and Uya 四代目菊川 aims to offer up its authentic rendition of the Japanese delicacy at affordable prices. The eels are carefully selected and this commitment to quality and freshness shows from the crispy, fluffy, and creamy unagi. In fact, the tare, or sauce, is made using Uya’s highly treasured secret recipe that has been passed down through the generations. The eel is delivered live from Japan and stored behind the kitchen before they are prepared and grilled daily. \n\nThe main star here’s definitely the Hitsumabushi served with condiments, broth, soup, and pickles. The best way to savour the different flavours is simply to divide the unagi rice into four portions and enjoy it with some condiments, with the dashi broth and condiments provided, on its own, or any way you like! Different flavours come through with every quarter, making for a delightful culinary experience that’s truly exciting. No part of the eel goes to waste, so don’t forget to try the Kimoyaki (grilled liver) and the Hone Senbei (Bone Crackers) - they taste as delicious as they sound intimidating. Don’t pass up on this gem even if you don’t enjoy unagi. Dishes such as the Rare Wagyu Rice Bowl, the Sashimi Moriawase, and Oyster Tempura will also give you plenty reason to return!

With all three owners having roots in either California or Texas, and growing up on true-blue Mexican eats, it’s safe to say they know a thing or two about the flavour explosion the cuisine brings with it.\n\nA quick glance at Vatos’ “Seoul-Mex” menu and you’ll know exactly what we mean. They dish out masterful fusion creations like the hefty Kimchi Galbi Grilled Cheese. Pieces of marinated Galbi short rib - bearing a moreish taste that comes from properly grilled meat - are sandwiched between slices of sourdough bread. Sounds simple? It's anything but. Each bite is a veritable bomb of umami, with Mexican cheese and savoury fried kimchi lending their own punchy kick.\n\nThe sandwich itself is pretty filling so if you prefer a slower pace, we recommend going for a range of their popular tacos.

From clinching one star in Wine & Dine's Top Restaurants 2018/2019 to hosting the most prestigious wine and whisky events – WAKANUI Grill Dining Singapore has upheld its rapport of quality cuts and refined dining experience in its stunning location at Marina One.\r\n\r\nDeveloped in Tokyo by ANZCO Foods, a New Zealand-based meat company specializing in premium-quality New Zealand beef and lamb in Tokyo, WAKANUI takes its name from the location of ANZCO’s Five Star Beef Feedlot on the coast of Wakanui, South Canterbury. The ‘stars’ of WAKANUI and the essence of the restaurant are New Zealand Ocean Beef and WAKANUI Spring Lamb, which are grilled over Japan-sourced Binchotan charcoal in the centrally-placed, open kitchen. The beef displays the perfect balance of marbling and leanness, while retaining natural juiciness and an intense beef flavour. The lamb possesses peak flavour and texture.

Catching a lobster during one of his typical leisurely diving trips off an isolated island, the lack of other ingredients forced Chef Lau Siaw Dee to throw together a quick meal using only rice, seawater, and the aforementioned crustacean. Surprise, surprise! The salty combination worked so well, it became an instant hit once Chef Lau brought it back home – after much refinement of course.\r\nToday's iteration is a Teochew-style porridge, whose loose grains float in a yellow broth that's been richly flavoured with lobster roe, accompanied by a bevy of fresh lobsters sitting under a blanket of fresh spring onions. It's both comforting and decadent without being too much on the palate. There's also plenty more on the menu that can round out your meal, from poultry dishes like Seven Spice Pork Choplets to local staples like Braised Yee Fu Noodles and Sambal Fried Rice.\r\nFor mouth-watering Chinese food that's packed with plenty of local flavour and an exceptional bowl of lobster porridge, only one place comes to mind, and this is it.

Set up by Swiss vintner, Dominique Giroud, and Swiss owner, Claude Dizerens, the space is a restaurant, bar, and wine cellar rolled into one. The inside is furnished in a modern style with plenty of dark accents and simple lines – perhaps all the better to highlight the food and drink. However, if you’re in the mood for ambiance that’s a little more laidback, the sidewalk al fresco area might be more to your liking.\n\nIt’s not often that Switzerland comes to mind when you’re in the mood for wine but that’s exactly what Wine Universe hopes to change. Besides the usual suspects from France and Italy, their incredibly extensive wine selection – easily over 50 types of wine – also introduces several Swiss options that often go overlooked. Worried about getting a little tipsy with only drinks and no nosh? Try some of the contemporary dishes on offer. Taking inspiration from the Swiss culinary culture, the menu comprises of items like Wiener Schnitzel, Escalope Viennoise, Raclette, Matterhorn  Rösti, and more.\n\nNot only does the lack of excessive crowds mean that the restaurant is a great venue to hang out at, the food and, most importantly, wine are also fantastic representations of the Swiss gastronomic landscape.

Its distinctive red lanterns, plastic chairs, and loud decor just call out to you as you walk past, not unlike the pervy men in the past who used to line this very street leering at the ladies of the night who used to operate around the area.\nXYT’s food, too, is loud, bold and in-your-face. Start your meal with the all-time classic, Braised Duck. At XYT, the meat of the duck is tender, yet provides enough of a bite to allow you to savour the juice of the sinews. To share, you will not regret ordering a Lu Rou Fan (braised meat on rice), which, at XYT, uses minced wagyu instead of the normal pork. The ubiquitous street food is thus upgraded to an almost unrecognisable form, but it is an evolution that we daresay is worth the calories. As the sun sets on Duxton Hill and lights from other eating establishments flicker on around you, sit back and reminisce about the days of old Duxton as you enjoy the retro charm with a cocktail or two from the XYT bar.

It’s a favourite amongst discerning diners looking for a quiet and discreet location for a luxurious and refined dimsum brunch, or more elaborate Cantonese feasts for special occasions. Expect the height of fine Chinese cuisine, shot through with the balance and richness of pure Cantonese cuisine. Nothing says special occasion quite like a Braised Whole Abalone in Superior Oyster Sauce, an entire lobe of the meaty treasure in an umami broth, paired with crunchy seasonal greens. A similar, less wallet-busting dish is the Braised Sea Supreme Cucumber with Corn Broth, a lovely blend of savoury and sweet flavours with the incomparable texture of high quality sea cucumber. \n\nCantonese cuisine is nothing without a soup centrepiece, and here there’s a stunning Double-boiled Sea Whelk Consommé with Garlic, served in a teapot for some extra theatre with the deep oceaney flavours. Meat dishes here come with a similarly high-end flourish. Think Pan-Fried Chicken with Morel in Superior Soy Sauce, a humble poultry dish given a dramatic gourmet kick with the addition of rare, earthy morels. Moving further along this French direction, two great cuisines meet in the form of a Pan-Seared A9 Wagyu Beef Fillet with Mushroom Sauce. If it’s dimsum and traditional Cantonese roasts you’re after, lunch and brunch on the weekends is the best time to hit up this joint, with its popular buffet options. Either way, this is a meal that will stick around in your belly and mind with its commitment to fine ingredients, lovingly and innovatively prepared.

Now in celebration of its 8th anniversary, it seems fitting that Yantra has collaborated with world-renowned Chef Hemant Oberoi, who has cooked for the likes of world leaders and celebrities such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.\nThis is not your typical North India - the dishes are inspired by flavours from all over India, but with a contemporary twist. One stellar example, the Chicken Tikka Fondue, is the perfect marriage between chicken tikka marinated in spices and yogurt, and a tantalizing cheese fondue. From the Seafood Rassa to the Thepla Tacos, the dishes are also telling of Yantra’s unyielding conviction of using the freshest ingredients and spices hand-picked and flown in from India.\nYantra also turns fine dining up a notch with an interior that conveys an effortless sophistication and elegance, a clever reflection of its food. The extended bar which boasts of an imaginative range of specialty cocktails like the Tandoor Mojito and intriguing whiskies from Scotland’s finest whisky producing regions is also majorly impressive. Enough said, we’re sold on this unparalleled dining experience!

Having worked in a medley of hawker kitchens - first as a waiter and then as a chef - gave Chef Ng the necessary expertise to craft halal versions of hawker classics. The menu at Yassin Kampung features a range of famous local dishes such as Chilli Crab and Fish Head Curry, and some with a contemporary twist - like the Buttermilk Salted Egg Yolk Chicken. There are sets available for groups of up to 10 people in a communal dining style - everyone gets a bowl of rice and a range of main dishes. \n\nThe Chilli Crab here is a must-try. Served piping hot, this dish consists of tender crab meat in a rich, spicy gravy and served with deep fried buns.

The menu spans inspired cold and hot appetisers, smokey grilled vegetable, meat and seafood dishes, beautifully singed skewered items and light desserts.\n\nHighlights include a delightfully refreshing cold starter of Nama Yasai - a platter of shaved raw asparagus and cauliflower tossed in an umami-rich vinegar-based seaweed dressing. Or pad your stomach for a night of stiff sakes with hot appetisers of Truffle Chawanmushi and Katsu Sando - a fluffy toasted sandwich of luscious thick-cut beef katsu smeared with pommery mustard.\n\nContinue the feast with succulent grilled Eringi and the flavours of Tontoro slow-cooked to tender perfection and finished over the grill. Meaty bites also come in the form of grilled Gyutan, Gyu Kalbi and skewers of Tebasaki, each expertly seasoned to draw out the rich, natural flavours of the ingredients. The hand-made Tsukune meatball lovingly moulded with a mix of house-minced chicken meat and with cartilage bits for a textural difference, is not to be missed either. Another signature dish from Chef Lee is the Inaniwa Udon, served with a prawn broth and topped with plump prawn tempura.\n\nComplementing the menu of hearty, bold-flavoured grilled items is a beverage programme with a strong sake focus. Patrons can also enjoy a range of Chuhai, Highballs and unique Yujin concoctions such as a Shochu Mojito or Yuzu Sour.

Located along sexy Amoy Street, the little quartier of the city that’s leading Singapore’s culinary revolution, the restaurant provides a great mix of laid back lounge vibes and upmarket dining experiences. In other words: sexy cocktails and delicious food. The menu brings the traditional fare of an Argentine bistro to the table, but gives it a modern makeover. One thing that remains, though, is the pride of place given to the custom-made wooden charcoal grill that infuses everything it touches with its signature smoky kiss. \n\nSo what is Argentine food? Think croquettes studded with smoky, spicy Chorizo, smoked peppers, and slices of duck ham served with preserved cherries and a cream of pecorino cheese. Classic Argentine empanadas come stuffed with braised cuttlefish, fragrant fennel, and chorizo, or savoury-sweet goat’s cheese with spinach, raisins, and pine nuts. Seafood mains are the next order of business, with plates like charcoal-grilled octopus served with crunchy fennel, new potatoes & samphire salad, and a homey tuna mayo. Argentine beef, the pride of the nation and, indeed, of this kitchen, comes in the form of the Caracu, a beef & marrow bone burger paired with braised ox cheeks, and a piquant salad of tomatoes, onions, and house pickles. For dessert, there’s none other than the fabled Dulce de Leche Creme Brulee & Banana Split Ice Cream, a combination of some of childhood’s favourite flavours: sweet toffee and creamy banana. Or maybe just wind down with one of the bar’s famous cocktails, like the boCHINche Sour, made from Amaretto-like Disaronno, apricot brandy, and lemon juice for a smooth and potent end to the meal. This is a gourmet experience close to the heart of Singapore’s new culinary wave, shot through with an Argentine love of good food, fine wines, and long, luxuriant dinners.

Highlights include Kenji's signature Amadai dish. The Amadai fish from Kyoto Prefecture is cooked in the traditional \"Matsukasayaki\" style where the scales are left on the fish and fried to a crisp resembling pine cones. This gives the fish a very unique combination of crispy and tender textures. While the cooking method remains the same, Chef Kenji comes up with new flavours to pair the Amadai with, based on the season, a reflection of his dedication to the craft.

Occasional Asian elements punch up the flavours here, a selection of small plates and smoky grilled mains all blessed with the smoky perfume of an imported Josper charcoal grill. The mains are super meaty-heavy so lighten up with some green small plates to share. A refreshing and crunchy Endive & Shallot Créme-Blue Cheese Salad is a good way to start, filled with bittersweet endive, walnuts, and creamy studs of fruity blue cheese livened by an orange-balsamic vinaigrette. Or start the meat-fest early with creamy Bone Marrow, paired with refreshing white wine jelly, a piquant tomato salsa, and chips of deep fried garlic.\n\nOnce the mains come along, it’s a parade of beautiful grilled meats and seafood. Think chewy and sweet baby octopus given a rapid sear under the grill before being tossed with squid ink rice, a paprika-spiced rouille and sweet sun-dried tomato. Savour the rare treat of a Free-Range Yellow Chicken, roasted and deboned then served with olives, tahini, lentils, and a curry brown sauce for some exotic Middle-Eastern flair. Bone-In Beef Short Ribs accompanied by zingy beetroot and pickled potato will satisfy the meatiest cravings, but go slightly overboard with a Tomahawk, not of beef, but pork, a giant chop served with roasted pineapple that’s been infused with rum. A good, practically festive meal served in hip, Instagrammable surroundings, fȳr is one of the great gems of downtown dining.

The warm, cosy space is lively and buzzing, constantly filled with the chatter of the many diners — it’s hard to just walk into iO expecting a seat — and staff bustling about with steaming plates of pasta. \n\nIt’s hard to resist starting the meal with bread, because the ones here are baked fresh in-house and speckled with delicious tomatoes or mushrooms. The Roman schiacciata, for instance, is a golden-brown flat bread with crispy edges, which you either enjoy plain or stuffed with earthy truffle. A must-order is the porchetta, rolled pork belly roasted until the skin is crackling with savoury juices and the meat is super tender. Pastas are the star for main courses — the baked lasagne, grandma style, is absolute comfort food. But the home-made tagliolini is a dish you’ll come back for, with the springy strands of pasta tossed with generous amounts of garlic, olive oil and chilli, and fresh, chopped prawns.

Located at the late Joel Robuchon’s former spot in Hotel Michael, this spot has made a name for itself as an unpretentious fine dining establishment. Helmed by veteran Dutch chefs Richard van Oostenbrugge and Thomas Groot - whose restaurant 212 in Amsterdam was recently awarded a Michelin Star - table65 serves up modern European fare and is their first venture outside of the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nDig into the Veal Tartare, a rich dish of light beef marrow and meat topped with a generous helping of briny Beluga caviar. The richness of the meat is tempered by the salty taste of the caviar, and makes for a standout combination of flavours. The Ceviche Passionfruit is a sweet and rich dish that combines a staple of Latin cuisine with the vibrant sweetness of passionfruit. The highly-raved Apple lives up to the hype. Made with an isomalt apple shell with a core of apple sorbet and chocolate seeds, this dish is delightfully light and sweet, and makes for a unique dessert.
